- > you [all] are on single initial basis now
	- Such a nice extension of being on a first-name basis with someone. Picked this up from Ryan over the past few months. R, KT, GE, GS, if any of y’all are reading this, 👊🏽
- Noticing a lot of my private journal entries starting with “Such a dense day.” [Despite the media narratives about 2017](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/892048053074616320), personally—and I recognize that this comes from a place of privilege—this year has been the best yet. Here’s to the weeks ahead.
- Ryan M. gave me such a [nice shoutout](https://twitter.com/warpling/status/892182775159078912) about my SC profile. Made my day. I spend a large portion of my day with headphones on listening/curating music, so to know it’s affecting others for the better makes me really happy.
- R dug through some of my [old tweets](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/636348783471788032) which brought up such great memories. Also, reminded me of just how much I’ve changed since moving to NYC (to where I almost view Jasdev from _n - 1_ years ago as a goof haha). Cities are forcing functions for course corrections.
