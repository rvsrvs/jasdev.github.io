- A recurring theme in noticing amongst podcast interviewees is that chasing ’happiness’ is a lost cause (much more of a fleeting emotion). Instead, a common thread is to instead strive for a steady state of contentedness. Noticing consistent meditation helping with this. Things that usually bothered me (e.g. my flight that was just cancelled), seem to brush off with way less friction.
- I actually enjoy joining new social networks. The prospect of creating new, more compartmentalized social graphs is [exciting to me](http://jasdev.me/growing-up-with-facebook).
