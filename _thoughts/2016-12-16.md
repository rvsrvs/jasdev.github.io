- Haven’t travelled outside the US (not counting Canada) since my trip to India in my teens. That needs to change in 2017. On the list:
  - Berlin
  - Sweden
  - Iceland
  - Japan
  - (will append to this as more come to mind)

- Sounds like the journal has hit home with Shiva. He mentioned a few points that make this journal feel worth it: he mentioned that he checked the journal more than Instagram or Twitter, maintaining an identity outside of traditional networks is important, and the thought of this journal has come up multiple times for him over the past few days.
- His thoughts on this sparked my response: “I’ve noticed with this style, it requires peeps to poll it every so often (as opposed to push with social), which is somewhat refreshing because it comes from a place of genuine interest.“
- About to spend the weekend with my brother and the family for his graduation. Proud of him more than he realizes. To be honest, I wish I had been more vocal about this over the past few years.
- Finally finished “Spark.“ Can’t thank Zack enough for the recommendation. That book came into my life at just the right time.
