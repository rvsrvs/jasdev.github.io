- Grateful
- Whenever I’m in a group at a party/event and I see someone walking around alone, I try to invite them to the conversation and catch them up. This stems from the fact that I used to/still am often in that situation where I feel socially isolated at times and don’t want others to have to feel that uneasiness.
- I was initially nervous about meditating in the office the other day. But, after a few people saw, they came up to me later and told me they’d like to join!
- “Thumbs on glass“
