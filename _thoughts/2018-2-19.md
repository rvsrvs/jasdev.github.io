- I couldn’t be more thankful for friends who [help me grow](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/869938469153492999) through (brutally) honest feedback. But, sometimes it’s hard to decouple that commentary from me as a person. Feeling a bit deflated tonight after the critique from the last two posts. I have a lot of course corrections to make and I’m determined to stand back on my feet in drafting the next essay.
