- After chatting with certain people in my life, I’ll either notice that I have more or less *energy* after the conversation. Definitely want to stay close to those who induce the former. [Hanging with Ashoka](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/804174855021195264) this past week reminded me of this.
- Spent the entire day just reading. *Still* days like these feel amazing.
- One thing I really admire about [Lickability](http://lickability.com) is how [they allow friends to join their Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB7pop61oLg). A common desire for employees is to [work with friends](https://medium.com/@fat/twitter-bootstrap-b95033c270af#.68tmqbn14), what a great way to bring that in-house.
- Reading [Jordan’s post on Spectacles and how they’ve affected his *thinking*](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/805164678808793088), I’m starting to realize this for myself and Twitter. The network is definitely more valuable than FB, Instagram, etc. for me personally, but I want to decondition this tendency to think in small ’bites.’ Might go on read-only hiatus for a bit and post here.
