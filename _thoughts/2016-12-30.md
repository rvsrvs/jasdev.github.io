- Been quiet on the journal front. It’s 1:13am and I’m struggling to distill these past few days into thoughts. Not a bad thing necessarily. Got my follow-up ultrasound yesterday, so I’ll have some closure in whether or not I need another surgery. Either way, I’ll be stronger because of it.
- I have a couple of physical goals, post-surgery. One that I’m public about is my desire to enter my first cycling race. Can’t wait to start training once this injury clears up. Until then, I’ll be putting in mental work.
- Saw some old friends that I haven’t seen in over two years. Felt incredible to catch up and some of them have even moved into the city. Walking home right now just smiling. Noticing that my best days usually end like this.
