- Been pulling back from Twitter over the past few days. I’ve mentioned that the service has continually [made my life better](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/845097060349218816). While this is still (mostly) true, I’m hitting a season where I’m directing my energy elsewhere. Building Constellation, writing, training, and dating. Interpolating empty moments with an information firehose doesn’t give me the space to think _independently_ or sit with my thoughts. I’ll still skim the timeline every _few days_, make sure my [friends are heard](https://twitter.com/mb/status/776982859794046976), and reply to @-mentions/DMs. Three days in and I already feel healthier off the mental treadmill. More generally, a lot of folks [point at Twitter’s short form nature](https://dcurt.is/what-i-would-have-written) being the culprit here. I feel like this slightly misses the bill. Short-form content is inherently fine. It’s the lack of well thought-out content and backing research which makes Twitter (broadly) feel like empty calories. I don’t think the answer here is a complete Twitter abstinence. However, I need to explore the other end of the spectrum to gut check my usage.
