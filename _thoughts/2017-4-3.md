- Concepts, learnings, and things that seem to “come into your life when you’re ready for them.“
    - Meditation
    - Learning about your parents’ past
    - Joy of reading
        - Despite being gifted to me over a year ago, I finally read [WBBA](https://www.amazon.com/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/081298840X) last month. I couldn’t put it down. The first book in a while that had this effect on me.
- These things _should_ be introduced at an early age, but are _better absorbed_ when we naturally find ourselves gravitating towards them on our own accord
    - Reminded of this by [Eric’s tweet on emotional control](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson/status/848189594403262465) and efforts by public schools in using meditation instead of detention.
- Fifth book of the year. While I tweeted out before about not counting books, there is no better feeling than finishing a good one (and putting down one that isn’t right for you)
- Missing writing and projects a lot.
