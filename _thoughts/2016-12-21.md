- Sacrificed a bit of sleep last night to just talk with the roomies. Haven’t laughed so hard in a long time. Went to bed yesterday with a warm heart.
- Excited for the recharge days to round out the week. Finally finding a balance between making the most of my evenings socially and allowing time to myself.
- No meetings today. Let’s do it.
  - Looping back at the end of the day. Finally cleared out a bunch of backlogged messages and emails. feels_good.png
- Really excited for 2017. As Shiva had mentioned during our last checkin, we both have grown an immense amount over ’16. Here’s to even more growth (in both expected and unexpected ways).
- Shared an excerpt from this journal on Twitter today and it resonated with a few peeps. Can’t wait to make this public.
