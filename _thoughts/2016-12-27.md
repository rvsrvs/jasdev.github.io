- Found myself creating two notes in my journal the other day: one for date spots in NYC (I used to do this during previous relationships, a good sign that my heart felt the urge to write some ideas down) and one moonshot note about names for the kids I hope to have someday.
- Chatted with Ryan today about ways to “shock the system“ in different domains of our lives. Taking fitness as an example, marathons are a way of raising your baseline. In work, switching jobs (and the subsequent interviewing you have to do) accomplishes this. We tried to suss out other ways to do this in areas like reading and relationships.
