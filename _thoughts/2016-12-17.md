- Brotherâ€™s graduation ceremony in the morning. Havenâ€™t cried this much in a few months. Sounds awkward, but, crying more frequently (whether it be from laughter, love, movies etc.) *feels* healthier.
- Even though I graduated two years ago, college feels like a chapter long gone in my life. Probably because looking back, *so much* has changed for me personally.
- Watching Nisha help my Mom set up her Snapchat warmed my heart. I do a pretty good job of calling my Mom regularly, but voice and texts donâ€™t really give her a lens into my life. Excited to change this. If youâ€™re reading this journal, Iâ€™d like to do the same with you: snapchat.com/add/justdavesingh
