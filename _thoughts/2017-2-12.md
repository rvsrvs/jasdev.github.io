- A bit delayed, but finally got the time (and energy) to sit down and write some thoughts from this past week.
- Small moments of joy when walking through the city:
	- Noticing someone smiling at their phone and imagining them either sending (or receiving) a message from a loved one
	- Audibly laughing aloud to yourself during a funny moment in a podcast
- Speaking of podcasts, this is the best ad I’ve heard: “This show is sponsored by X and they asked us not to read an ad.”
- Easy wins that I’d add to the next version of watchOS:
	- Mindfulness minutes (whether through the Breathe app or HealthKit) being a part of the activity rings (could even be a binary indicator in the center of all of the rings, which would be a subtle metaphor)
	- Variable move goals. If I hit 750 calories each weekday, I’m going to be a vegetable on the weekend. That’s okay and the Activity app should cater to that.
- The more I think about it, meditation helps me (in the larger scheme of things) in the same way Track and Field helps an athlete have a baseline level of competence in any (read most) sports.
- Have another social leap of faith planned for this week. Fingers crossed.
- Learned how to make matcha lattes today, so tempted to buy a frother. Imagining making lattes for my future partner on a cozy weekend morning warms my heart.
