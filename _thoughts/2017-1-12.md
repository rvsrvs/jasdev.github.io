- Dust has settled after my latest post on pouring my whole self into work. Seemed to resonate with peeps ❤️
- Took a leap of faith socially today. More to come on this.
- Lots of intersection with Ryan’s constants that make his days better, for me:
  - Physical exercise
  - Meditation
  - Walking to and from work listening to music
  - Deep work in the office (been tough these days with more boring testing tickets)
  - Calling my Mom
  - Reading (been good about bed-time, should wake up earlier to get in some am reading)
