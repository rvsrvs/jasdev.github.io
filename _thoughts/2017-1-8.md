- Iâ€™ve found comfort in realizing that advice, books, and hobbies (e.g. meditation) often donâ€™t â€™clickâ€™ until certain parts of our lives. Itâ€™s as if we have to be in the right state (emotionally, physically, maturity-level, etc.) to digest them. Donâ€™t beat yourself up if a book recommendation didnâ€™t resonate with a friend, it might just be the wrong time.
- Funny how I spent today procrastinating on the post I logged about yesterday by writing a different one ðŸ™ˆ
- First Sunday-coworking from Balanced. I practiced going first by suggesting this membership tier and now itâ€™s officially a thing!
  - The space is how I aim to design my own apartment (and how Iâ€™d like to design my house someday).
  - Our trajectories take us on unexpected paths. Over 18 months ago, I was reading [Leo](https://twitter.com/LeoWid)â€™s posts on the Buffer blog. Now, Iâ€™m side-by-side in the same coworking space.
