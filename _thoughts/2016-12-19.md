- Despite the cost (which can somewhat be justified by the potential savings down the road by being in good health), I’ve come to love working with a coach/trainer. They help me build a better version of myself, while providing me with a friend I see multiple times a week, outside of my normal social circle.
- Really missed the apartment mates while I was gone this weekend. Writing this entry now as we all sit in it living room, coexisting, yet silently connected through all we’ve been through (lived with them for a couple of years back at UVA).
