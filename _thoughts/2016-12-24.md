- Meditation is starting to become normalized in my family. It’s no longer awkward when I’ll take 20 minutes to myself to sit in an adjacent room to recharge.
- Body is still exhausted from this past five workouts week, going to throttle back this coming week.
- Found myself randomly checking Ryan’s thought journal as well. Felt like going beyond the surface level of his online persona (Snap stories for the time being). Journals like these are special.
