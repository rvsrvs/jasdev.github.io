- Foods I’ve changed my mind about (which I now enjoy)
  - Almond milk
  - Sweet potatoes
  - Tea
  - Brussel sprouts

- “We’re all playing our own game, but also the referee of it.“
  - Spontaneous dinner w/ Ryan at Dig Inn. Funny how we’re all going through the same emotions in parallel (Ryan, if you’re reading this, “ambient,“ *air quotes* ).

- Checkin w/ Shiva in 30. We have *a lot* to recap. This will likely be our last session of 2016. Onwards.
- Friends who push back on what we discuss/do are refreshing. Many peeps blindly accept what others say (or stay silent), when challenging what’s said could help the other person grow in ways they didn’t expect.
  - Today, Shiva reminded me of this when I told him about “digital listening.“ Sure, there is a place for pulling back from posting on social media. But, you can still be the person you want to be without abstaining from services like Twitter.
- Shared a link to this journal for the third time.
