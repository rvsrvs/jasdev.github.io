- Shared a link to this journal for the second time.
- Continuing on Arjun’s personal value of having a bias towards action, a decent framework for this is to assume most *negative* outcomes are your fault (within reason). Taking this view feels a bit more action-oriented. Take losing an important document because the power went out as an example. Sure it’s bad luck, but when you ask yourself “damn, that’s my fault, how can I prevent this?“ Magic starts to happen. I could have instead backed up my documents continuously. Still ruminating on this.
- Abstaining from sharing content on social media is almost a way of practicing “digital listening.“
