- Just because technology can enable anyone to build anything they want to exist, doesn’t mean they *should*. This is because, as programmers, we often lack the background to understand the anthropological implications of our creations. This is why I want to go back to school and study cognitive science. Mixtures of the two fields will be entire [areas of research](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/813548745841197056).
- Sounds obvious in retrospect, but a crucial second half to allowing myself more space to do meaningful work (writing and side projects) is proper energy levels. Two main contributors for me personally I this regard: sleep and recharge time (since I’m more of an introvert, spacing out time with friends, instead of back to back social outings in the week).
- Looking back on my interest in track during high school and passion for cycling that developed over the past year, I’m realizing that I love endurance sports. Threads mental grit with physical training.
