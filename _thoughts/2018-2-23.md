- Worked through the slump and landed on the next [first draft](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/967254640344616961)! Earned my fatigue today. The only sour part of today was that I’m still battling an annoying medical issue, hoping it passes soon.
- The SF/Vancouver trip quietly snuck up on me. Can’t believe it’s less than two weeks away. Can’t wait to have time/space to make headway on Distillations.
