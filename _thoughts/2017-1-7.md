- Quiet on the journal front. Tail-end of the week had a lot to digest and many hilarious moments. Randomly thought about an old blog post idea that I’ve had in the queue for a while. Going to outline it now to get some momentum:
  - The Death of Services
    - Highlight recent shutdowns like Vine
      - Entire swaths of history can vanish (worried about Soundcloud)
      - [https://twitter.com/fvrmvn/status/791857105040908288](https://twitter.com/fvrmvn/status/791857105040908288)
    - My approach to storing certain types of media
      - Notes: make sure that all clients I use are backed by Markdown files (easily transfer to different services)
      - Spectacles: backup all circular videos
      - Passing on backups of journals and Dropbox accounts to loved ones in the case of an emergency
      - Content from shutdown services will be the “old albums in the grandparent’s attic“ of our generation
