At 26, the word ‘decade’ rarely finds its way into my vocabulary, especially when describing hobbies I’ve kept. Thinking about it, strength training and programming might be the only two. The latter started from a place my parents initially disapproved of, yet was formative in ways I couldn’t quite predict: modifying Xbox’s to cheat in online video games.

The community referred to this as ‘modding’ and the first-person shooter, Halo—specifically 2 and 3, in that order—, was my favorite game. Modding is an involved process. I saved my allowances (and the money I earned from creating online forum signatures in Photoshop), convinced my mom to drive me to the local Costco to buy an Xbox (only to later repeat this trip many times over), pry open the case (voiding the warranty), and solder in components that sported names like “SpiderChip,” occasionally burning holes in the carpet or bricking the Xbox entirely. The carpet damage seemed to concern my parents the most.

Once installed, mod chips unlock the console and allowed me to load arbitrary game files—the mods—onto it. They ranged from subtle to absurd. Marginally increasing aim assist to causing weapons to emit bridges—you read that right—, which could be used to box in our team’s flag in “Capture the Flag“ (CTF, as we called it) matches.

The hobby got me in trouble (I was banned from Xbox Live twice) and also into my highschool’s AP Computer Science AB program, which, at the time, meant sitting in the back of a Trigonometry class with an exam prep book. I spent the next decade majoring in the field, flying across the country to work at Imgur as an engineer, and back to NY, where I helped build Tumblr and now Peloton.

Engineering has bylined a large chunk of my life and now I might be stepping away from it.

- Set the Peloton stage
- “University-Length gut check”
- “calculate vulnerability“
- escape valves and “I can return to engineering” being true, yet not fair. I can’t carry out Plan A if I keep focusing on Plan B.

- “might“ audit
- We do the same in strength training by picking two body parts
- Marked by what I wear (mechanical versus Apple Watch)
- Contrast
- Handling the lack of visible “output” in management
- Bimodality to workaround
- Social abstractions
- Code is a liability

- The arc of my work lengthened—year timescales (illustration)
- Value Arcs
- “I've been thinking a lot about the term "calculated vulnerability". I've seen a lot of my peers write after the resolution of a something hard (overcoming an illness, shutting down a startup, IVF etc) after a happy ending, neatly packaging their vulnerability in a bow. But what if that happy ending doesn't come? Do you just stay in a purgatory? Do you just stay in silence? I've been wondering about what my "resolution" will be so I can start publishing again. This self-imposed hiatus is basically me waiting for a satisfactory resolution in order to start writing again.”

Avoiding Calculated vulnerability in talking about my experience with management

Noticing that I thought through escape valves before giving it a fair shot. I can always return to engineering.
