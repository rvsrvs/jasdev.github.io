At 26, the word ‘decade’ rarely finds its way into my vocabulary, especially when describing hobbies I’ve kept. Thinking about it, strength training and programming might be the only two. The latter started from a place my parents initially disapproved of, yet was formative in ways I couldn’t quite predict: modifying Xbox’s to cheat in online video games.

The community referred to this as ‘modding’ and the first-person shooter, Halo—specifically 2 and 3, in that order—, was my favorite game. Modding is an involved process. I saved my allowances (and the money I earned from creating online forum signatures in Photoshop), convinced my mom to drive me to the local Costco to buy an Xbox (only to later repeat this trip many times over), pry open the case (voiding the warranty), and solder in components that sported names like “SpiderChip,” occasionally burning holes in the carpet or bricking the Xbox entirely. The carpet damage seemed to concern my parents the most.

Once installed, mod chips unlock the console and allowed me to load arbitrary game files—the mods—onto it. They ranged from subtle to absurd. Marginally increasing aim assist to causing weapons to emit bridges—you read that right—, which could be used to box in our team’s flag in “Capture the Flag“ (CTF, as we called it) matches.

The hobby got me in trouble (I was banned from Xbox Live twice) and also into my highschool’s AP Computer Science AB program, which, at the time, meant sitting in the back of a Trigonometry class with an exam prep book. I spent the next decade majoring in the field, flying across the country to work at Imgur as an engineer, and back to NY, where I helped build Tumblr and now Peloton.

Engineering has bylined a large part of my life and now I might be stepping away from it.

Coming on four years post graduation, it’s sinking in that I’ve done a “university-length” of full-time—specifically iOS—engineering. I’m beginning to wonder to if it makes sense to spend the next length keeping course or moving laterally, stepping away from code and towards management. A couple of months ago, my manager floated experimenting with the switch for a quarter. He’s spread thin with 20+ direct reports and could use the help. I would start with two “soft” reports, i.e. they’d report to my manager on paper, but to me in practice. And here I am—almost a dozen 1:1’s, a few books read, training to come, and a lot of internal doubt later, it’s been…tough.

I usually write essays when, looking back, the days appear to fit together. But, it’s hard to reflect on my management experience with such a [calculated vulnerability](https://feedbin.com/entries/6ee3c278512200693ef23ba6ba067b20c74cfb10/newsletter).

Sitting with this question of whether or not to switch to engineering management, two difficulties keep cropping up: recognizing the lengthened “arc“ of my work and catching myself imagining “escape valves” when/if I return to engineering, proper.

## Arcs of Work

The feedback loop of programming is incredibly short. Working at the level of technical abstractions let’s you write some code, compile and run it, and, boom, instant feedback. The social abstractions involved in management move glacially in comparison. It’s easy to _rationally_ recognize the value of enabling career development, building teams, and scaling processes. Yet, I find myself ending week over week running from meeting to meeting feeling as if I got no tangible “work” done.

The arc of my work has lengthened. I’m realizing that the lack of visible output of management is simultaneously frustrating and oddly rewarding. The impact of my efforts no longer last on the order of days and weeks. Instead, I need to think on yearly timescales and affect change that hopefully outlasts my tenure.

## Escape Valves

A piece of advice I keep getting handed is to not worry, “you can always return to engineering.” While true, it doesn’t seem fair to keep that top of mind when giving management a try. I can’t carry out Plan A, if I keep focusing on Plan B—I’m getting better at reeling myself in when imagining “escape valves.“ They’ll pop up from time to time. “Maybe I should do another batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)?” “I could potentially squeeze in some open source after work?” The valves are innocent in isolation, but, too much dwelling can cloud my ability to assess whether or not management is right for me.

I’m not quite sure how to bookend this. Writing publicly in real time is new to me—as is management. However, whether or not I decide to step away from code, it’s reassuring to know that I’m stepping towards either plural “decades” of programming or starting a new decade of focus entirely.
