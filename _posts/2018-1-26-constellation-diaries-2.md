# Orbit Dynamics

Note: I’m going to use the term “edge“ to represent the link between two users in Constellation. For example, the edge among Skyler and Alice represent their connection in the network. This terminology is borrowed from [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), where nodes in a graph are related by directed or undirected edges (I’ll cover Constellation’s approach to directionality towards the end of the entry).

A thesis 

- Network moving with reality.
	- OmniFocus, FB graphs going stale
- The lack of _directed_ pulses makes it tricky to fade out orbits from inactivity.
- The assumption that our inner circle is static doesn’t hold true and that’s okay.
- How to gracefully end orbits?
	- Re-upping every _N_ months/years feels awkward with partners
		- But, it might be a decent enough approximation to start with
	- Fading on any metric of “inactivity” ultimately might affect behavior. Take
