There’s no dancing around it—we all have a finite number of heartbeats, breaths, and seconds on this planet (and potentially Mars). However, the curious thing about time is its elastic nature. Seemingly infinite high school summers. One-on-one’s that stall when you ask for a raise and then domino back towards a regular cadence. Assuming we’re not moving near the speed of light, time marches forwards at a constant rate. But, our _perceptions_ of it change. I’ve become fascinated with ways to slow down this perception.

We’ll cover three aspects that appear to be at play: new experiences, busy (or idle) minds, and tempo.

## New Experiences

When everyday routines aren’t punctuated by newer experiences such as travel, different schedules, or novel tasks, we shift into autopilot. We’ve all been there. A friend will ask how your week went and, after pausing to reflect, the past few days resemble an amorphous stretch of time. This dynamic is typically attributed to spending time in “[System One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems)” of thought. Daniel Kahneman presents the duality between “System One” and “System Two” in the notorious tome: “[Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).” To summarize, the first mode is reserved for low-energy cognitive tasks; those that are “fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, or _unconscious_.” Examples include ordinary commutes, performing pre-computed arithmetic (`10 * 10 = ?`), or finishing trite phrases (“To be, or…”). The second mode is more effortful and _conscious_. Newer experiences, performing an unfamiliar exercise, or following a math proof all land in this bucket. A second-order effect of these modes is a dilation of time. Our perception of time contracts when the unconscious thoughts of System One string together. On the flip side, the neurogenerative nature of System Two makes us more aware of the gaps between thoughts, dilating that perception.

Surfaced awareness of the gaps between thoughts brings us to the next topic—how busy or idle our minds are.

## Busy Minds

I firmly believe that a [busy mind accelerates the passage of time](https://twitter.com/naval/status/769745071675539456). Constant context switching, obsessive ruminations, and other forms of “mental load” not only shorten the space between thoughts, but also [inhibit our capacity for originality](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/opinion/sunday/think-less-think-better.html). How do we remedy this? I think the answer involves allocating uninterrupted spans of time to experience boredom, let the dust in our minds settle, and get into flow.

Boredom hit hard during my first, week-long, silent retreat. I hesitate to include this anecdote, since describing the experience might alter my relationship with it or be interpreted as a latent [form of signaling](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/972274896486223872). But, I want to honestly distill it here, in hope that it helps folks, like me, whose insatiable information diet has made boredom a privilege.

Seven days without reading, writing, speaking, or direct eye contact (one of the retreat rules) made me realize just how rarely I get bored during everyday New York Life. It got to the point where I would take longer showers just to read the labels on my shampoo and conditioner bottles—yikes. Around the third day, I began shifting my appetite for mental stimulation towards paying attention to what was around me. I vividly remember spending 45 minutes staring at a tree on Wednesday evening. The remainder of the retreat was the longest few days of my life, in the most fulfilling sense. I was reminded that time actually moves incredibly slowly when we’re present to soak in the world around us.

This isn’t to say we should strive to be present at all times. Going on autopilot during commutes or chores might better allow us to deploy our attention towards experiences we want to magnify. Another instance where speeding up time is desirable is flow. It usually occurs when [thinking and being present](//thinking-about-thinking) are in harmony. When you’re so in tune with the task at hand, that your sense of space and time is lost.

A lot of the discussion around “being present“ is framed as a deliberate, _additive_ behavior. I’m starting to question whether this is accurate. What if we’re innately present and the trick is giving ourselves enough space and time to realize this and rest in that awareness?

## Tempo

Let’s explore tempo, and its relation to time, in handful of domains. Namely, music, clocks, and mental/physical circadian rhythms.

### Circadian Rhythms

- The moving walkway of time is slow, it’s us who’s sprinting
- Time as a grid overlay on our lives
- Days so dense that they have seasons
    - Fractal and self similarity nature of time
    - Using previous “chapters” as mile markers (“life as a series of colleges”)
