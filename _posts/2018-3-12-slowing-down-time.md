There’s no dancing around it—we all have a finite number of heartbeats, breaths, and seconds on this planet. However, the curious thing about time is its elastic nature. Seemingly infinite high school summers. One-on-one’s that stall when you ask for a promotion and then domino back towards a regular cadence afterwards. Assuming we’re not moving at the speed of light and have a normal circadian rhythm (we’ll touch on this in a bit), time marches forwards at a constant rate. But, our _perceptions_ of it change. I’ve become fascinated with ways to slow down this perception.
