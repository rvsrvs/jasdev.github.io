A common sticking point that meditators face when catching themselves lost in thought is _thinking about thinking_. For example:

- I’ll [mentally note](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/11/04/noting-technique-video/) that I’m ruminating on a past experience.
- Instead of returning to the present, I’ll accidentally __think about__ the note I just made.
	- Getting lost in thought isn’t necessarily bad. However, it’s important to know when doing so is causing a disservice.
- Then, I’ll think about the aforementioned thinking.
- The process usually recurses a few levels. That is, I’ll think about the thinking…about the thinking.

“Thinking about thinking” throws off longtime meditators because their acute awareness can _sometimes_ be a crutch in causing them to lean into thought. I encountered this during a [retreat in May](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/824997535483826176)<sup>1</sup>. However, during office hours with [Jonathan](http://jonathanfoust.com/about/), we attempted to bucket the states our mind can be in, as a way to _flatten_ any potential meta-thinking.

In the above division, one is either present or thinking<sup>2</sup>. If we assume that these two states are _mutually exclusive_ (I’ll touch on the potential intersection in a moment), then “thinking about (thinking about…) thinking” gets reduced to, well, _just thinking_!

Can you think and be present concurrently? My gut says the intersection of these states is what we typically refer to as [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). When you’re so in tune with a task at hand, that everything else takes the backseat.

It seems contradictory that I’m regarding these states as being mutually exclusive when I want to prevent “thinking about thinking,” but allowing them to intersect when it comes to flow. [Nick Szabo](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4) calls this holding of contradictory possibilities “[quantum thinking](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2012/07/more-short-takes.html)” (fourth bullet point).

> […] You should disagree with yourself. Totalitarian thought asks us to consider, much less accept, only one hypothesis at a time. By contrast quantum thought, […] demands that we [simultaneously] consider often mutually contradictory possibilities.

The thinking/present distinction is the first instance of quantum thought I’ve come across, since reading their post. Maybe we’re constantly oscillating between the present and thought that when we actually attain either _specifically_, we truly notice it. In any case, this has been in my stream of consciousness for a couple of weeks now, so I wanted to write it down.
