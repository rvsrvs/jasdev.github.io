# Cadence

Cadence, whether measured in rotations per minute, story points per sprint, workouts per week, or tweets per day, cycles through my life.

Pun aside, I chose the phrasing, specifically. I work at Peloton, whose flagship product was its bike (and now the [Tread](https://www.onepeloton.com/tread)).  Cadence tops my list of future kid names[^1]. And, the engineering community keeps cadence with its half-honored borrowing of the “sprints” metaphor from athletics—where work is compressed into two-week sprints staggered one after another, quarter over quarter[^2].

More generally, as we move away from The Feed[^3], we get to pick mental cadences—instead of having the pace at which friends, news, and Content® are surfaced chosen for us. Sundays are now [spent reading newsletters](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson/status/1097300084465811456). They’re also (often) spent apologizing for failing to send out last Sunday’s.

It might be time to reevaluate our—read my—association with the word.

Am I writing monthly over at [_Distillations_ ](https://jasdev.me) to be “seen” in digital space, even though I’m present in meatspace? Am I tweeting seven times a day—17.6k tweets over seven years—because there’s something to say or am I maintaining a sort of external pulse? Was my sports hernia an unlucky injury or a side effect of overtraining to avoid [breaking the streak](https://zachholman.com/posts/streaks/)? 

This isn’t to disavow cadence. It serves a purpose. Keeping cadence builds a foundation, whether it be a writing, gym, or posting habit. Yet, once that foundation is built, it’s healthy to spot check and, if needed, break stride.

The copy on the social media platforms we use don’t often help. Posts are underscored with “_X_ days ago” timestamps that encourage “talking” over “listening” (the latter is often labeled as “lurking”). I hope the narrative around letting go of a posting cadence to spend more time listening becomes common. Not posting doesn’t imply a lack of presence, which might point at a flaw in the mechanics governing today’s services. If we’re all busy talking, who’s listening?

Cadence even defines the buckets, [(M, W, and D)AUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users), we fall into on dashboards behind company walls. Being in control of our feeds—whether through reverse chronological sorting, newsletters, or RSS—is a step towards maintaining individual paces. Still, we shouldn’t bucket ourselves in the same way used to measure user engagement. It’s Okay to start a weekly newsletter only to realize, later, monthly, or later later, whenever you can, works better. Put another way,

The first order of cadence gets us going. The second order of cadence—the cadence of cadence, itself—isn’t well defined. 

And that’s probably for the best. Fingers crossed Cadence, my future child, not the word, finds this out sooner than I did.
