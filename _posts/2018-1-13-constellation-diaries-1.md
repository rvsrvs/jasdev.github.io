# Engineering Double Duty

Welcome to the first entry of Constellation Diaries. A less polished space for thoughts, troubles, and progress in building my next product: Constellation. The second post will properly introduce the project. However, I wanted to start by writing about the first sticking point I’ve faced.

36 weeks into 2017, I began deploying more time towards [writing](/). An average week would involve [pouring my heart](/whole-self) into Peloton Monday through Friday and [navigating the trenches of essay drafts](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaxhOVtAr4E) during evenings and weekends. I felt like my truest self. When I think about what I want to work on for the next 50 years, two trajectories come to mind. Writing and building products that make ourselves (or lives) just a little better. I’ve spent the past four and a half months _heavily concentrated_ on the former. With Constellation, I’ve finally found an embedding of the latter. A common narrative in the industry is “I want to start my own company someday.” I’ve lightheartedly held onto this, qualifying the narrative with “…when I find the right idea, time, or [insert noun that feigns justification for procrastination].” Well, I’ve finally found _that_ idea and the rubber is hitting the road; which brings me to the topic of this entry.

# Engineering Double Duty

I’m fortunate enough to have the [privilege](https://twitter.com/parrots/status/818986455473291264) and energy to pursue creative work (essays, side projects, and the like). Channeling my efforts in the past towards writing was a refreshing change of pace from the engineering I do at Peloton. When I started working on Constellation a month ago, I viewed writing and the project as mutually exclusive usages of my time. It was a conservative way of being honest with myself. Between training, work, reading, friends, and dating, I _realistically_ thought I had one “life slot” left. I put my OmniFocus “Writing” project [“on hold”](https://support.omnigroup.com/documentation/omnifocus/mac/2.6/en/projects/#projectstatus) and felt marginally better by telling myself “I can always write _later_. On the other hand, I won’t always be an engineer.”

This worked for about two weeks. My days shifted from the aforementioned engineering/writing split to a narrow stream of…just engineering. While I love the craft, I quickly realized engineering double duty is hard. Persuading myself to open Xcode for a second shift was a test of mental willpower that I could maybe pass for a few more weeks. Writing was my escape and made me a better engineer. I missed it; which is the reason behind the words you’re reading right now.

Moving forward, I’m not going to treat writing and Constellation as zero-sum. I can have both. It might come with a slower cadence, but it’s a healthier bifurcation (and let’s me [enjoy the view](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/99269a5edd00d81d0655f8609530229f55080f2a/daily-list.md#L18)). Concretely, this diary will be my outlet. I have some thoughts around bringing my essays and Constellation [under a single roof](https://github.com/DistillationsCo) that we’ll cover down the road.
