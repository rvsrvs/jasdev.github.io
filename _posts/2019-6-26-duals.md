While the [debut of Apple’s Combine framework](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/722/) didn’t quite take center stage, its implications on our community certainly will for the next decade. We now have a first-party—and unfortunately closed-source[^1]—toolkit for functional reactive programming (often abbreviated with “FRP”) that packs an intimidating [namespace of operators](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publishers), opaque abstractions such as [`Subject`s](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subject) and [`Cancellable`s](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/cancellable), and features even Combine’s open-source counterparts omit like [backpressure](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/demand).

This post aims to unpack the those adjectives, ‘opaque’ and ‘intimidating,’ that are often lobbed at FRP when folks retreat to its more familiar sibling, imperative programming. Let’s start with contrasting the two.

## Imperative and Reactive (er, Declarative)

- Examples of each in achieving the same end. 
- push and pull
- https://youtu.be/3XTQSx1A3x8

## History

- Computer science education often covers only one side of the coin.
- RAC and Rx(Swift)

## Duals

- Introduce the co- phrasing
- Light CT introduction

## Hiding in Plain Sight

- Product and Sum types (and their biases in Swift)
- Lenses and prisms
- Effects and co-effects
- Pullback, Brandon’s example of pulling back predicates
- Domain, co-domain

## From `Iterator` and `Sequence` to `Subscriber` and `Publisher`

## Post-Modern Programming

- Moving from “how” to “what.“
- Incorporating the decades (plural) of leanings about structure and composition from Category Theory.
- Stepping off the engineering treadmill and finding stability in mathematics. Functions will (hopefully) never go out of style, and if they do, we’ll have bigger problems we’ll need to address first. Like re-thinking the entirety of Category Theory, which already refactored practically all of mathematics.
