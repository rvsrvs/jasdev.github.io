We’re at a point where the value of our education system is starting to be questioned—with freely available course material and MOOCs being cited as viable alternatives. On defense, increased serendipity and access to facilities have surfaced amongst the many justifications for the system’s existence. Yet, I’m beginning to realize a more fundamental concept that universities afford us: ladder construction. Just because the coursework taught at an institution is available online, doesn’t imply that we can make _effective traversals_ of that content. Schooling provides said content _and_ constructs a “ladder”—allowing us to focus on climbing through the material, instead of trying to simultaneously climb a ladder we’re building.

School is just one of the many forms ladders can take. My peers who made the least turbulent transitions after graduation were those who could go from the single-track ladder of college to climbing multiple ladders—knowing when to delegate construction externally versus building while climbing.

## Ladder Spectrum

Bringing this metaphor back from orbit, ladders serve two functions: a guided traversal through a domain—think sport or subject matter—and a feedback loop in _countering_ our tendency towards mean reversion. The spacing between the rungs on the ladder represent the resolution of the traversal. Are you being instructed from concept to concept or just sporadically checking in for accountability? A feedback loop should occur at each rung, allowing for course correction.

(Ladder spectrum illustration)

Who (or what) builds these ladders for us? Under this lens, a spectrum of solutions comes into sight: groups, friends, and coaches/managers.

### Groups

On one end, we have groups that build ladders. They can take shape as running clubs, traditional classroom settings, or meditation groups. The last example has been particularly impactful for me. I’ve been a Headspace user for the better part of the past five years. Yet, I’d regularly hit extended “plateaus” in my practice. The periods are hard to describe in such an immeasurable domain as mediation—but, I felt it. Sits started resembling a chore more than a 20-minute enclave in my day. I needed a ladder and a (now-defunct) group in NYC, [Balanced](http://www.balanced.nyc), built one for me in climbing out of these plateaus.

Week over week, we’d meet in [Casey](https://twitter.com/CaseyRosengren) and [Leo](https://twitter.com/LeoWid)’s loft in SoHo, sit for 20 minutes, and sift through a passage on topics like transitions, burnout, “being enough,” and cap off the evening with a group discussion. Even though the volume of my practice was roughly the same with Headspace and Balanced, translating it from a single-player journey to a ladder we all climbed—together—made all the difference.

Two nuances crop up in group settings: whether or not the feedback loop is enacted by a teacher or peer set and the fact that increasingly _larger_ groups tend to construct ladders that don’t fit each individual well.

The first nuance reminds me of an old thought from [Nikhil](https://twitter.com/nikillinit).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because your peers didn&#39;t have any say in your grade, you just needed to learn the rules the teacher had and play by them properly</p>&mdash; Nikhil Krishnan (@nikillinit) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikillinit/status/914636773447421952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

In ladders where evaluation only comes from a single person, e.g. a teacher, climbing faster, might inadvertently mean learning their rules and playing by them properly. This might be innocuous in most cases—however, it becomes a problem when the teacher’s rules and the reality of the course corrections you need to make diverge. Evaluation by a peer set (or [multiple perspectives](/seek-perspectives)) _might_ be more effective. An issue with evaluation by peer set is that the set is usually small for in-person contexts—pointing to a hybrid approach between IRL and Internet peers as a remedy. Still, that approach causes the second nuance, larger groups tend towards building inaccurate ladders. There will be times where you want to climb faster or slower than the ladder—moving along the spectrum helps with this.

### Friends

Friends land between groups and coaches/managers as a ladder constructors. My most-cherished friendships have all had the trait of inciting sustained, personal growth—[Shiva](https://twitter.com/ShivaKilaru) being the one I’m most thankful for.

Over the past year, we’ve added a notch between our [monthly checkins](/monthly-checkins): a weekly email recapping what happened in the week and the progress we’ve made towards our goals of kicking off [Krazam](http://krazam.tv) and Distillations (this essay collection). The format is dead simple.

```
# Midterm Goals

# Goal(s) for the week

# What got done?

# Honorable Mentions

# Goals for this upcoming week:
```

22 checkins later, I can honestly say this accountability ladder has single-handedly driven Distillations towards my longer-term goals for the project.

The weekly cadence here is key—long enough to make tangible progress, yet short enough to limit the time lost from procrastinating. Previously with our monthly calls, I would punt work to the last few days before the checkin, losing a potential month of headway. Shortening the rungs of our ladder from four weeks to one allowed us to course correct more frequently. There’s a downside here of course; by shortening the cadence, we might lose sight of the forest. So, we’ve kept our monthly FaceTime calls as an opportunity to zoom out and work through any concerns that may have shaken out in the weeks beforehand.

### Coaches and Managers

Coaches and managers land on the other end of the spectrum. I used to wonder why world-class athletes and CEOs were commonly seen as roles that necessitated coaching, leaving a potential gap to be filled for the rest of us. Yet, if you squint hard enough, coaches and managers are practically the same thing. Effective managers not only serve as umbrellas for their team, but also provide direct reports with regular feedback loops and guidance in climbing a company’s career ladder.

An added benefit of this one-to-one dynamic is specificity. Ladders are built to your trajectory, context, and preferences, instead of being muddied by larger group constraints. This makes the ladder easier to trust. “Luck” is teased apart by rungs that are spaced appropriately—better correlating efforts and potential outcomes.

## Countering Mean Reversion

- Getting out of a rut
    - Slowly elevate the mean through feedback loops
    - Climbing “out”
    - Spark => trainer => getting mental health in order
- Ladder construction anecdote from Samantha’s question about what I’m concerned about in my writing.
    - Could be a great driving anecdote for the the self-constructed ladder

## Ladder Intuition

- The case for no ladders (lack of metrics in SoulCycle) Potential for ladders and fun being at odds.
- It’s way easier to trust an external feedback mechanism. But, this doesn’t mean we should shy away from internal barometers—just that deploying them in areas of our life that matter is the key.
- > I have done this circuit both with and without a coach. Despite the similar levels of effort in each context, completing it with someone else calling the shots feels more rewarding. It’s as if the rungs on your “ladder” are created for you, allowing you to focus on climbing; as opposed to trying to simultaneously climb a ladder you’re building. More generally, this delegation of “enough” might explain the (more recent) proliferation of group fitness classes. They’re instances of having someone construct ladders for us.
