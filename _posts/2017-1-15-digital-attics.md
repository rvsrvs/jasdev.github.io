Electronic Dance Music is a [big part of my life](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/pubs/unbound/spr14/singh.php). So much so, that I wrote my [thesis on analyzing data sets from the genre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irAFO2rGvTg). Unlike other genres, the rate at which tracks, remixes, and edits are released is breakneck. Because of this, artists tend to gravitate towards Twitter-esque services for music like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh), where (re)posting multiple songs a day is common. I’ve spent years curating tracks on the service to the point where my _local_ music library is only a handful of albums—around three gigabytes worth—that have [attached themselves to memories](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/328698506397245440). Recent news that [SoundCloud posted a $53 million loss in 2015](http://mixmag.net/read/soundcloud-may-run-out-of-cash-after-suffering-a-51-22m-loss-in-2015-news) caused me to think about how a potential shutdown would impact the community at large and me personally. Due to the centralized tendencies of the web today, entire swaths of digital history<sup>1</sup> can vanish from record.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vine is the latest reminder that we are creating a Digital Dark Age w huge gaps in the historical record (via obsolescence or deletion) 😩</p>&mdash; jenny (@fvrmvn) <a href="https://twitter.com/fvrmvn/status/791857105040908288">October 28, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I’ve been thinking about ways we can make digital “passings,” [like that of Vine](https://medium.com/@vine/important-news-about-vine-909c5f4ae7a7#.2er2e8gxk), less painful on both a macro and personal scale. Let’s start with the macro, by reflecting on Vine.

Under the safety net of Twitter, Vine opted to enter a [ready-only mode, release a version of the app that only allows local/Twitter sharing, and provide downloadable archives](http://help.vine.co/post/152688513385/discontinuing-the-vine-app-faqs). Moreover, GIPHY pitched in and built a [migration tool](http://giphy.com/giphylovesvine).

This seems like the “right” way to do it. A _read-only_ period gives users a moment to brace for the shutdown and a _write-only_ tool grants creators the ability to produce atomic units of the service, despite its (future) absence (and hosting). When it comes to migrations—no matter how well-intentioned—it’s hard to look past the fact that they’re essentially passings of the torch. Of course, with any hosted service, this process can (and will) continue indefinitely as they rise and fall. Third-party mirrors<sup>2, 3</sup> (preferably those backed by governing bodies) will probably be our most durable bet. The [challenge of preserving public digital records](https://twitter.com/jack/status/814924317590962176) will be one I’m excited to see our generation(s) take on with the help of historians.

On a personal level, I’ve tried to approach to backing up important files—photos, videos, notes, and journals—as creating a digital attic for my future kids to (potentially) climb into one day. Structuring the folders to be intuitive, yet allow for a meandering exploration of my digital life. My files range from the typical—[screenshots](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/705791847319347200), camera uploads, and [journal entries](/small-moments)—to the intimate—9th grade Algebra 2 assignments, [voicemails from my parents](https://twitter.com/maiab/status/751500059875782656)<sup>5</sup>, old notes on fun date spots/ideas, and failed attempts at a video diary. More concretely, I store these  digital memories in formats I _think_ will stand the test of time—or at least be easily convertible to their successors. Plaintext ([Markdown](https://twitter.com/jxxf/status/789275320696406016)), PNGs, MP4s, and MP3s have been some of my picks.
