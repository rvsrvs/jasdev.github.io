WWDC is a conference like no other. This past month, I was lucky enough to experience it as a part of Tumblr’s [iOS cohort](https://cocoa.tumblr.com/post/146758581738/wwdc-2016-has-come-and-passed-but-we-wanted-to). While my peers have done a fantastic job [recapping the conference’s highlights](https://swiftnews.curated.co/issues/91#start), I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the smaller details, things that went well, and things I wish I had done differently.

## Recharge Days and Exercise

This is something I regret not doing during the week. At times, WWDC can feel like a marathon. It doesn’t have to be that way. Take a day to [explore the city](https://www.instagram.com/p/BG5jDpLNaw_). [Catch up with old friends](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGyVICpta3I). [Squash lingering email](https://twitter.com/mb/status/743516855076171776). [Get a guest pass to a local gym](https://twitter.com/wahoo/status/741405799344267265). Time off can help you [recharge](https://twitter.com/Sommer/status/741899695492976641).

## [Layers 2016](https://bringyourlayers.com)

I truly believe the magic of WWDC week is in the people you meet, not the actual sessions themselves[^1]. If I were to do it all over again, I’d attend [Layers](https://bringyourlayers.com). Layers is a three-day design conference for the macOS and iOS community and in their words: a “party, but for learning.” Moreover, [Casey Liss’ post on his experience](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/6/17/layers-2016) convinced me to attend next year.

## Attending In-Person Podcast Recordings

Podcasts have become a huge part of my life, since moving to New York City. Commuting from Park Slope to the Flatiron District each day gives me about an hour[^2] of idle time to learn via auditory osmosis. During the week of WWDC, both [RelayFM](https://www.relay.fm) and [John Gruber](https://twitter.com/gruber) from [The Talk Show](https://overcast.fm/itunes528458508/the-talk-show-with-john-gruber) hosted in-person recordings of episodes[^3]! I definitely hope to attend some of these events next year to help put faces to the voices I listen to each day on the way to work.

## Twitter

I recently uninstalled Twitter from my phone[^4]. However, during WWDC, I made an exception. While the service gets a lot of flak, it has the magical ability to foster community, [coordinate spontaneous lunches](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/743827770401165313), and [facilitate serendipity](https://twitter.com/joshavant/status/743178026259615745). The iOS community on Twitter is stellar and it truly shines during that week.

## Aggregating Team Questions for Labs

Tumblr’s iOS app has ~20 contributors. At this scale, questions were bound to come up when reading through the [API diffs](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/iOS10APIDiffs/). To coordinate and answer them for folks who couldn’t make it, we created a spreadsheet with links to [sample projects](https://github.com/paulrehkugler/OptionalityChanges) and relevant [Radars](https://openradar.appspot.com/page/1). This allowed us to divvy up the questions and better relay them to Apple engineers during the labs.

## Attend a Random Session

When plotting out sessions I wanted attend, I decided to sprinkle in a random one for the fun of it. I chose “[Working  with Wide Color](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/712/)” and was blown away. Being a math major in university, I’ve always been fascinated by color theory. This session provided an in-depth walkthrough of the [P3 Color Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3) and how it affects various color APIs on Apple’s platforms, something I would’ve easily missed otherwise!

## Wear Your Company/App’s Shirt

I picked this tip up from an [episode of Under the Radar](https://overcast.fm/+FgnZ09-xk). Countless conversations throughout the week started by recognizing the logo of an app on someone’s shirt. It’s a simple way to facilitate introductions and thank the developers who work on your favorite products!
