(Assumed audience: folks with a working knowledge of Combine and the [`ObservableObject` protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject).)

Materialization, like “[fusion](/fusion-primer)” and “[dual](/duals),” is a seemingly intimidating term for a not-so-intimidating concept.

When I first encountered the word, I thought it was over the top. And it kind of is. This entry tries to bring it down from abstraction and into Swift.

## <[aliens-guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens)>Errors as values</aliens-guy>

We’ll often need publishers to drive client-side errors views—which, seem at odds with Combine’s `Publisher` contract:

> [After sending a subscription to a subscriber and they request values,] the publisher is free to send that number of values or fewer to the subscriber.
> 
> …, if the publisher is finite, then it will eventually send a [_single_] completion or an error.

—[WWDC ’19, Session 722 (timestamped transcript)](https://asciiwwdc.com/2019/sessions/722#t=408.346)

Receiving only a single [failure](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/completion/failure) (or [finished](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/completion/finished)) event makes retrying and displaying error toast views (as an example) difficult. We’d seemingly have to peek into the `‌receiveCompletion` argument of either [`Publisher.handleEvents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204713-handleevents) or [`.sink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3343978-sink) and then re-attach the new publishers generated by retry attempts.

Not ideal.

This not-ideal’ness stems from completion events being _terminal_. There’s sound practical (and theoretical[^1]) reasons for this and we’ll need to bridge the gap by moving our involved `Publisher`’s `Failure` generic _into_ its `Output` type.

“Into” in that sentence is a bit vague. Let’s pause with it.

Publishers emit either `Output`-typed values or `Subscribers.Completion<Failure>` terminating events or some (or none) of the former and a single (or none) of the latter.

So, we have a way of translating any publisher to one in this form (subbing in `AnyPublisher` as a placeholder, for now),

`AnyPublisher<Output, Failure> ⇒ AnyPublisher<Event<Output, Failure>, Never>`.

I’ll need to properly introduce our new friend, `Event`. It’s an enumeration to represent the possible events a subscriber may receive.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/5afdb2544530745ea0749e9093dec063.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/5afdb2544530745ea0749e9093dec063).)

It’s also worth noting our older friend[^2], `Never` prevents the transformed publisher from error’ing out.

This is all sounds nice and well. But, [what’s the point](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep0-we-launched#t92)?

By materializing errors into a publisher’s output, we can then react to them in the same way we would handle ordinary values.

Or, rather, we’re considering our errors as values.

## Two implementations

I skimmed over how the `AnyPublisher<Output, Failure> ⇒ AnyPublisher<Event<Output, Failure>, Never>` transformation works, so let’s fill that in.

We have two options: lean on existing operators or sketch out our own `Publisher` conformance. There’s tradeoffs for each and since there’s [prior art](https://github.com/CombineCommunity/CombineExt/blob/83c71501d41e2f9e6ccc701032c3d6ee0b03c6fc/Sources/Operators/Materialize.swift#L52-L70) for the latter in [CombineCommunity/CombineExt](https://github.com/CombineCommunity/CombineExt), we’ll go with the former.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b334cdb3c79efc50fef555b223df5cdd.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b334cdb3c79efc50fef555b223df5cdd).)

Now, we an start chaining operators, case by `Event` case.

Values? We need to box ‘em into `Event.value`.

Leaning on Swift’s generation of static, embedding functions for each case. i.e. `Event.value: (Output) -> Event`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/cf5e768834e68c678585f6c8941d8c59.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/cf5e768834e68c678585f6c8941d8c59).)

`Completion.finished`s? Well, we need a way of silencing upstream’s finished event and then turning around and publishing an `Event.completion(.finished)`. Thankfully, the framework ships with a few [`.append(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204683-append) overloads.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/5e6cbd30c78cbf5a9b5a83e4d822cc82.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/5e6cbd30c78cbf5a9b5a83e4d822cc82).)

And lastly, (and densely[^3]), catching error events.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b83638fe55a0ca4aebfa4a689fff71e6.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b83638fe55a0ca4aebfa4a689fff71e6).)

That’s a lot to digest—let’s recap (and maybe take some Tums).

We’re doing three things.

- Lifting emitted values from upstream into the `Event.value` case.
- Intercepting completions with the `append` operator and turning around and sending an `Event.completion(.finished)` to subscribers.
- Catching any `error`s, boxing them up into a `Event.completion(.failure(error))`, and pass it along as a value event.

## Dematerializing

Materializing—in a sort of pseudo-Swift syntax—takes a `Publisher<Output, Failure>` and lifts it to a `Publisher<Event<Output, Failure>, Never>`, shifting errors over to the value side.

However, consumers might only be concerned with specific `Event` cases. Think content views backed by `Output` instances or error views driven by `Failure` values.

We need a way of lowering a previously-materialized sequence, or as [our wise elders](https://github.com/antitypical/Result/blob/c0838342cedfefc25f6dd4f95344d376bed582c7/Result/Result.swift#L84-L88) called it, “dematerializing”

To start, we might be tempted to extend `Publisher` with an `‌Output == Event<Output, Failure>` constraint.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/a80b24f64cbc4c90e54d898bae9f02a7.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/a80b24f64cbc4c90e54d898bae9f02a7).)

Sadly, the compiler can’t reconcile the recursive constraint. We’ll need to introduce an intermediary protocol, `EventConvertible`, [following Rx’s lead](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/9b31a15520306b073cb9d46456f64826c1d6dcab/RxSwift/Event.swift#L92-L109).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/67dd1174dcc42cb7a18dcb1831451ef5.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/67dd1174dcc42cb7a18dcb1831451ef5).)

In both `values` and `errors` we’ll wanna focus in on upstream `Event.value` and `.completion(.failure(_))`s, respectively. There’s a couple of ways we could go about this—e.g. filtering out other cases or compacting associated values à la Point-Free’s [enumeration properties](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep52-enum-properties).

The latter route is more fun—and of course, the former isn’t any less valid.

To start, let’s add computed properties to `EventConvertible` to pluck out either an associated `Output` or `Failure` value.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/4269976ed2551c27639cbab081f921f5.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/4269976ed2551c27639cbab081f921f5).)

These optional properties tee us up `Publisher.values` and `.errors` to `compactMap` them out.

## “All together now (materializing and dematerializing).” — The Beatles…I think.

We’ve been walking along materialization’s perimeter, lifting and lowering sequences to and from their materialized forms, and you might be rightfully wondering, “[y tho?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/y-tho)”

To answer that, let’s extend Point-Free’s example of [pinging `random.org`’s API to fetch a random integer](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep42-the-many-faces-of-flat-map-part-1#t880).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/10432abe75d246f4b0dc3d9066f37287.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/10432abe75d246f4b0dc3d9066f37287).)

With `randomNumberPublisher` in hand, we can imagine a view model leaning on it to respond to pings to fetch a random number.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b03a492f413d6da1f50bb6758870edbe.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b03a492f413d6da1f50bb6758870edbe).)

Now’s let’s `send` on `randomNumberPing` a few times and see what happens.

Giving the above a few (or many) runs will hint at what’s wrong. We’ll either see one (or two) received value events with even integers or, a _single_ error event. That is, if the first request errors out, we never attempt the second.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/53ccd1da979ba488a083ea6a62580b7c.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/53ccd1da979ba488a083ea6a62580b7c).)

And while not ideal, it checks out that a failure in the first request would preclude attempting the second. The `Publisher` contract states that an error event ends a publisher from further emitting values, effectively rendering our `viewModel` instance above inert after a failure.

It might be tempting to rework `RandomNumberViewModel.init` with error handling.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/d246ade5c20c6ad6a531fb3dbe42277e.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/d246ade5c20c6ad6a531fb3dbe42277e).)

Then, well, we run into a problem. We have no way of disambiguating between an initial and error state, since they both bear `nil` values. Moreover, if we had more errors than `RandomDotOrgError.failedRequest`, we’d possibly squash them down into a single value.

(De)materialization—as you probably guessed—has a say in this matter.

First, let’s upgrade `RandomNumberViewModel.randomNumber` from an `Int?` to a type that better relays error and loading states.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/432803d9002fec10d46272aad29e430a.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/432803d9002fec10d46272aad29e430a).)

And then, leaning on `DataLoadState` and wiring everything up.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/7736fe314960abdb90c5da539c477469.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/7736fe314960abdb90c5da539c477469#file-random_number_view_model_materialized-swift).)

Let’s take a breather. That was a ton of scaffolding to climb through, but, now it’ll pay off. We can sketch out a sample `ContentView` against `RandomNumberViewModel` with a button to fire off requests, honor loading states, and present a sheet with either a random number or error in under 30 lines (including new lining and the like).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/68a3968a5b96b471c7d1020dce9439cb.js"></script>

([Gist permalink](https://gist.github.com/jasdev/68a3968a5b96b471c7d1020dce9439cb).)

## Prior art

You’re probably—and rightfully—thinking that performing the `materialize`-`share`-`values`-`errors` dance on every `ObservableObject` conformance is going to be…a lot.

The community agrees. Thankfully, we can stand on their shoulders. In the past, folks have abstracted away materialization under a higher-level type called `Action`.

It comes in a few flavorings:

- [ReactiveSwift’s](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/blob/e27ccdbf4ec36f154b60b91a0d7e0110c4e882cb/Documentation/FrameworkOverview.md#actions),
- [Rx’s](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/Action),
- and [ReactiveCocoa 2.0’s](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjC/blob/1af6617f007cae727dce48d2031cc1e66d06f04a/Documentation/FrameworkOverview.md#commands).

Each exposes observables and signals (other readings of “publishers”) [like `Action.errors`, `.elements`, and `.executing`](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/Action/blob/d1d01df963d9704bc728e9d6ffa1f775d6ade168/Sources/Action/Action.swift#L33-L40) corresponding to `DataLoadState`, above.

…is there a Combine `Action` analog?

Stay tuned, [Adam Sharp](http://twitter.com/sharplet) has something in the works [over at `thoughtbot/CombineAction`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/CombineAction).
