At the moment, I have three “mentors,” all of varying ages. [Alice](http://twitter.com/alicexyr) at 22, [Shiva](http://twitter.com/ShivaKilaru) is 26 (my age), and [John](http://twitter.com/jxxf) coming in at 34. Before diving in, let’s clear the air around the quotes on the word “mentor.” I wholeheartedly believe mentorship is _bidirectional_ and the set of folks you give this label to can, and should, _change_ over time. This flies against the traditional notion of mentorship—making me question if it’s the right thing to seek in first place. The usual narrative claims we should find a mentor (singular) early in our careers and indefinitely stay under their wings. In more _static_ domains such as woodworking or orchestra, that one-to-one, apprentice-like setup might be enough. However, in fields where knowledge has an incredibly short half-life,—think medicine or engineering—time fogs the lens through which any one mentor can assess the context of your situation.

Perspectives are more effective to seek out. Visualizing a career as a trajectory in some _n_-dimensional space, let’s imagine the range spanned by your experiences as a sort of “candlelight”—illuminating a neighborhood in that space. Other’s will have differently-sized lights proportional to their experiences and backgrounds. The illustration below assumes _n = 2_, because, well, my drawing skills are already poor. So, I can’t imagine the outcome at _n > 2_.

(Career trajectory through space with candlelights)

Note about not disqualifying a single mentor. But to be honest with ourselves if their experiences can intersect with ours.

- Just like we cross-polinate techniques across domains, we can do the same wiht our trajectories in life

- Getting every axis of a dimension covered is practically impossible. The intent here is to get a large-enough span.
