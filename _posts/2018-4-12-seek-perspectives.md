At the moment, I have three “mentors,” all of varying ages. [Alice](http://twitter.com/alicexyr) at 21, [Shiva](http://twitter.com/ShivaKilaru) is 26 (my age), and [John](http://twitter.com/jxxf) coming in at 34. Before diving in, let’s clear the air around the quotes surrounding “mentors.” I wholeheartedly believe mentorship is _bidirectional_ and the set of folks you give this label to can, and should, _change_ over time. This flies against the traditional notion of mentorship—making me question if it’s the right thing to seek in first place. The usual narrative claims we should find a mentor (singular) early in our careers and stay under their wing, indefinitely. In more _static_ domains such as woodworking or orchestra, that one-to-one, apprentice-like setup might be enough. However, in fields where knowledge has an incredibly short half-life,—think medicine or engineering—time fogs the lens through which any one mentor can assess the context of your situation.

Perspectives are more effective to seek out and age is just  one dimension to strive for variability. If we’re all in some _n_-dimensional space, where _n_ is the number of axes that make us unique—think race, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, physical abilities, etc.—then getting the most perspective on a decision will likely involve consulting folks _outside_ your _n_-dimensional neighborhood.

(The illustration assumes _n = 2_, because, well, my drawing skills are already poor. So, I can’t imagine the outcome at _n > 2_.)

Of course, there are two caveats here. First, constructing a peer set that covers every dimension is practically impossible. The intent is to get a large-enough span and then stand at the intersection of divergent influences. Second, this isn’t to disqualify traditional, long-term mentors—but rather to be honest in checking whether or not their experiences are relevant to your immediate situation. There are a couple of aspects to this check: knowledge half-life and longitudinal bias—we’ll dig into both and cover some ways to seek perspectives over mentors in practice.

## Knowledge Half-Life

## Longitudinal Bias

## In Practice

- Drive home “room“ metaphor and clarify physical and digital forms
    - Making independent thought an act of discipline rather than willpower through diverse streams of thought
        - Section from Emotional Ranges post
    - Twitter gender breakdown tool
