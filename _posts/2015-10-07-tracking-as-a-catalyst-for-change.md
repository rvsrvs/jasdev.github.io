When building a new habit, maintaining momentum is often the hardest part. Starting small helps, but I often need a larger impetus. To tackle this, I began tracking factors associated with each habit. For example, last year, I decided to spend less time on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook). I did not take this habit seriously until I installed [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com) and saw how much time I was wasting. RescueTime is a small app that runs on your computer (and Android device), and tracks how much time you spend on specific applications and websites. Turns out, I was spending ~28 hours per month on social media alone! I was appalled by this realization. If this trend had continued, I would be wasting more than a day each month on social networks. I was driven to change.

Fast forward to today[^1], where I now average 11 hours on on social media per month (21 minutes a day). A 61% improvement over the past year! The key takeaway here is that although I did not have a target metric, the act of tracking itself persuaded me to change my habits.

Tracking has spilled into many other areas of my life:

- Mood

    Over the summer, I was getting over a challenging breakup. To cope, I decided to actively track[^2] my mood using [Moodnotes](http://moodnotes.thriveport.com). Moodnotes is a thought journal that helps you log your mood and what influences it. This has allowed me to better be at ease with my emotions and prevent negative thoughts from snowballing.

- Food

    I am consistent with exercise. However, my diet consists of an unclear strategy of picking “healthy” foods, without actually tracking macronutrients. To solidify this approach, I began tracking meals with [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com). Once my diet became balanced, I transitioned to using [Lark](http://www.web.lark.com). Lark is more personal, as it uses a virtual coach to cheer you on in making healthier choices.

- Money

    [Mint](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mint-quickview/id533491939?mt=12) will always be in my desktop menu bar. Having all financial accounts in a single dashboard is invaluable. For example, I quit coffee after realizing how much money I was wasting (~$100 a month), in addition to the benefits of a caffeine-free diet.

- Age

    I never truly appreciated how fast time moves until I installed Sam Soffes’ [age ticker screensaver](https://github.com/soffes/motivation). Watching my age tick upwards each time I opened my computer reminds me of life’s finiteness[^3]. I even ported this concept to an [iOS app and Today Extension](https://github.com/jasdev/impulse)[^4]!

## Where do we go from here?

While tracking these domains is the first step, I believe the future of human improvement lies in aggregating them in a meaningful way. This is where we can make even deeper conclusions about our lives. Currently, my bet is with [Anand Sharma](https://twitter.com/aprilzero) and the [Gyroscope](http://gyrosco.pe/) team to solve this. Their site (and upcoming app) integrates with various services to present your life in a beautiful dashboard.

It is fascinating what you can do with all of this data in a [single place](https://gyrosco.pe/jasdev/). You can see [every place](https://gyrosco.pe/jasdev/explorer/) I have been to since 2012[^5] or check my most recent [heart rate measurement](https://gyrosco.pe/jasdev/sport/).

## Final Thoughts

While habit change often involves moving towards specific goals[^6], tracking is often eye-opening enough to incite positive change. Insight on metrics I want to improve has enabled me to better coordinate my efforts. After all, you can’t reach your north star goals without establishing a frame of reference.
