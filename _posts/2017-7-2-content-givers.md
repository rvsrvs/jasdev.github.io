Our routine is like clockwork. After each [hangout](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUFscWDApi3/), [Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan) and I will exchange [photos](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/862051865529286656) and videos to store in our [digital attics](/digital-attics). This habit sparked from the realization that although it’s [hard to approximate how many photos our generation takes each year](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/8/19/how-many-pictures), a quick scroll of our Camera Rolls shows just how _rarely_ we take photos of ourselves and others.

When was the last time someone took a great, candid photo of you? How special did it make you feel? When you do this for others, you probably won’t remember the slight faux-awkwardness involved and __they’ll almost always be thankful for it__[^1]. Ryan calls these folks “Content Givers.“ They’re a rare breed these days. Taking the extra moment to document [small moments](/small-moments) and share timestamped assets can help increase the surface area of any friendship.

## Footnotes:

[^1]: This, of course, goes without saying that the subject is comfortable having photos taken of them. Tangentially, I’ve seen this navigated extremely well by the wonderful folks over at [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com). They color coded conference lanyards to indicate levels at which attendees were alright with their photographs being used (i.e. not at all, taken with permission, public, etc.)
