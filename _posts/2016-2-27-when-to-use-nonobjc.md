In my free time, I run a Twitter account called [Public Extension](https://twitter.com/PublicExtension), where I share handy Swift extensions I‚Äôve found or come up with. A recent extension involved adding [custom subscripts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Subscripts.html) to [`NSUserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSUserDefaults_Class/).

One attribute that sticks out is `@nonobjc`. Often times, you‚Äôll need to use `@objc`[^1] to expose your Swift classes that don‚Äôt derive from an Objective-C class to the Objective-C runtime. It‚Äôs rare to _explicitly_ cut that interoperability. Let‚Äôs dig into why this attribute is necessitated here by dropping it and deconstructing the compilation error:

![](/public/images/nonobjc_error.png)

The full error reads ‚ÄúSubscript getter with Objective-C selector ‚Äô`objectForKeyedSubscript:`‚Äô conflicts with previous declaration with the same Objective-C selector‚Äù (and the analog for the setter). Turns out that Objective-C also supports [custom subscripting](http://nshipster.com/object-subscripting/) and Swift will automatically bridge them back! However, in our example, we‚Äôre overloading the subscript with the same key and different return types (also referred to as return type polymorphism), which Objective-C doesn‚Äôt support üòî. To fix this, we simply prevent the default bridging via `@nonobjc`.

So, there you have it! A real example of the `@nonobjc` attribute in action. Hope this post sheds some light on why it exists üòÉ

Shout-out to [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) for the help and [Garric Nahapetian](https://twitter.com/garricn) for motivating me to write this post!

## Footnotes:

[^1]: Swift also allows for the `@objc(name)` variant, which uses `name` when exposing the target class to the Objective-C runtime.
