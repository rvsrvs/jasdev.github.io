(Assumed audience: folks familiar with Combine’s syntax. Prior knowledge of zipping isn’t necessary, since I’ll build intuition and link to resources—but, if you’re already familiar with the topic, feel free to skip to “[a variadic `Publisher.zip`](#a-variadic-publisherzip).”)

Zipping is backed by a metaphor that fits quite naturally. If you’ve used a physical zipper, your intuition is already primed.

Specifically, when a type supports a `zip` implementation, two (or more) of its instances can be _paired_ in the same way teeth on a zipper meet when closing. Let’s ground this with a Standard Library example, `Sequence`.

## Two-ary `Sequence` zipping with `zip(_:_:)`

Sequences are lists of any size, including empty and possibly infinite lengths. And if we have two in hand, what’re some ways to pair them?

_pausing, so you can brainstorm._

Maybe return all possible pairs, channeling an inner-[Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product)?

Maybe losing information and pairing the first with a specific member of the second?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/970c074f5686141fa0a178da05ada9c3.js"></script>

Or, maybe walking across both in lockstep.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/62b08d4ce4f3be5bb487341f0088fb8e.js"></script>

While each have merits, the Standard Library ships with the third variant under the name [`zip(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1541125-zip). It walks over two sequences, index-wise, and stops once it reaches the end of the shorter.

[`Zip2Sequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/zip2sequence) bookkeeps this traversal (which is why I opted for `≈` in the snippets above to avoid `Array`-casting).

Let’s [search for “zip” across Apple’s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/search/?q=zip).

…aside from the above free function and results from Combine, there isn’t anything else.

And that’s where we’ll fill in some gaps to exercise our intuition. Starting with an [arity](https://jasdev.me/notes/parity-arity) three `zip` overload—i.e. a `zip(_:_:_:)` that accepts three sequences (and for simplicity, returns an `AnySequence` of triples).

Here’s some scaffolding we’ll work on.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/5cbbf814e8f1bbd542dace0a59f5ead3.js"></script>

If we apply Swift’s provided `zip(_:_:)` twice, we can start sketching an implementation.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b65351418a8ce2fe31325bcef90318a9.js"></script>

To transform the unflattened—un[splatted](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blame/53c2e80bdede03b99aee683fe6399b6e4cf0bf95/proposals/0029-remove-implicit-tuple-splat.md#L31)?—form into an `(Sequence1.Element, Sequence2.Element, Sequence3.Element)` we need to `map` before finally wrapping everything in an `AnySequence.init` call.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/eeeaccf991e4e94725651551c371dfb2.js"></script>

The `($0.0, $0.1, $1)` expression is dense—don’t second-guess yourself if you need to squint at it for a while. I certainly did.

All right, roll call. We’ve read through an existing `zip` in the Standard library and extended it. What about writing our own? That’s next before crossing over to Combine.

## Implementing `Result.zip`

Swift packs its own [`Result` type](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/53c2e80bdede03b99aee683fe6399b6e4cf0bf95/proposals/0235-add-result.md).

(For the unfamiliar, the linked SE-0235 proposal is an introduction to comb through before reading on.)

If we have two `Result` values in hand, then, like we did with `Sequence`, we can consider “pairing” them. To begin, we have to pick a case, `Result.success` or `.failure`. Let’s consider the  success path, since we often favor (and map over) it.

So, assuming we have a `Result<Success, Failure>` and `Result<OtherSuccess, Failure>` we need to return something in the form `Result<_, Failure>`.

A tuple is a natural fit for the paired, success generic. That is, `Result.zip` (in method form) would have the following shape:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/8292cc02b465ded09dc602f7d07c365d.js"></script>

`switch`ing over `(self, other)` guides the implementation.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/1cde6ba9befb9e81e70315d55511429b.js"></script>

Now we can pair up `Result`s when they need to align along `.success`—e.g. imagine we need to check both a username and password with two validation functions, say `checkUsername: (String) -> Result<String, CredentialError>` and `checkPassword: (String) -> Result<String, CredentialError>`. `Result.zip` lets us chain `checkUsername(someUsername).zip(checkPassword(somePassword))`, returning a `Result<(String, String), CredentialError>`.

You may have noticed a downside to this approach (that’s also commented in (4)). We’re dropping `checkPassword`’s error, if `checkUsername` is also in the `.failure` case.

The Point-Free duo covers this in [Episode #24](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep24-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-2#t98) and presents a generalization of `Result`, `Validated`, that allows for errors to be accumulated across zippings.

## A variadic `Publisher.zip`

Roll call number two.

So far we’ve extended Swift’s free-function `zip(_:_:)` an argument-length to `zip(_:_:_:)` and implemented `zip` on `Result`.

Now we’re ready for some Combine.

Let’s see which overloads the framework ships with,

- [`Publisher.zip(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204779-zip) (and a [transform variant](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3333685-zip)).
- [`Publisher.zip(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204780-zip) (again, a [transform variant](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3333686-zip)).
- [`Publisher.zip(_:_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204781-zip) ([you know the drill](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3333687-zip)).

And this is a solid set! Having a few, finite `zip`s lets us create higher arity overloads and the transforming versions save us a `.map(/* (_, …, _) -> Transformed */)` cal, while better colocating transformations.

Still, there’s a missing piece. What if we don’t know the publisher count ahead of time?

We ran into this quite often at Peloton, especially when dealing with older, strictly-RESTful APIs.

An endpoint would return a list of identifiers, and then _per_ identifier, we’d have to fire off another request to fetch metadata.

We’d usually treat these requests as all-or-nothing (if one fails, we’d bottom out the attempt) to simplify loading views.

To start the implementation of a variadic `zip`, we’ll need to extend the `Publisher` namespace.

When adding Combine operators, we have two options: composing existing operators[^1] or, when needed, filling out a `Publisher` conformance.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/b801901063d88bf91f01021d5b908726.js"></script>

If we zoom in on the parameter and return types, clearing the syntactic fog around `AnyPublisher` and re-writing `Publisher`’s associated types as a kind of generic, here’s what we’re dealing with:

`[Publisher<Output, Failure>] -> Publisher<[Output], Failure>`

An array of publishers to be zipped into a single publisher emitting an array of `Output`s.

Other communities call this “flipping of containers” or the [Haskell synonym, `sequence`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:sequence) (no worries if that link is incomprehensible, I added it so you can recognize the term when working across languages).

We have an array of publishers and need to…(spoiler alert)…reduce down to a single publisher. [`Sequence.reduce`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/2907677-reduce) to the rescue!

The method takes both an `initialResult` and `nextPartialResult` argument which brings us to the next question, when zipping arbitrarily many publishers, what’s the “initial result?”

In our case, it’s `self` (with some form adjustment to match the return type).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/1a78e883cc8f8145dccf63d4d6a0002b.js"></script>

Now to reduce the remaining publishers. In pseudocode shorthand, if we have `Publisher<[Output], Failure>` and `Publisher<Output, Failure>` arguments, we need to fold the lone publisher into the array-emitting publisher.

Maybe we can two-`zip`?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/d619c33f60a90db2834b68f4b62e86b6.js"></script>

Almost there! There’s a wrinkle to iron out: the `AnyPublisher<([Output], Output), Failure>` and `AnyPublisher<[Output], Failure>` mismatch.

And it’s a `map` away.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/d80decb26421a7f343eda339fcf37f5c.js"></script>

⌘ + B’ing should finally work again.

Time to recap the path we took.

- Combine’s `Publisher.zip`s top out at arity three. Which, works well when we know the publisher count at compile time.
- When we don’t, we can lean on the existing overloads and reduce and flatten to build a variadic version.

Now, how would call sites look? Starting with a fabricated—and then more practical—example.

Imagine we had five timer publishers, each emitting with intervals ranging from 0.1–0.5 seconds and we wanted to lockstep emissions to the longest interval[^2].

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/0f505d027f029efd47e71b45aec9793c.js"></script>

Even though the publishers in `others` are _faster_ than `first`, zipping gates them to emit in tandem. Each array the sink receives will be `first` and `others`’s first, second, third, …, *n*th value events, respectively.

Or, less abstractly, assume we have an array of user identifiers and want to (in an all-or-nothing fashion) make an API request per ID then collect the results.

To make our overload more ergonomic, let’s add a `[Publisher].zipped` variant.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasdev/93c5ff2fe56c8f48dd2b9edd1ff99e02.js"></script>

## Looking forward

“Now what?” - [Those fish from _Finding Nemo_, after reading this far](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1142233-finding-nemo).

[I landed](https://github.com/CombineCommunity/CombineExt/pull/6) these overloads in a community collection of Combine extensions, `CombineExt`. So, it’s a CocoaPod-, Carthage-, or SPM-installation away.

We can then turn towards related combining operators and ask if they have variadic overloads.

`Publisher.merge`? Turns out it’s [tucked away in the `Publishers` namespace](/notes/merge-many).

`Publisher.combineLatest`? Like `zip`, it has an arity three ceiling. But hang tight—that’s what I’m [working on next](https://github.com/CombineCommunity/CombineExt/pull/10)!

An added benefit of composing existing operators is that back pressure handling comes for free, since each inner operator respects the [`Publisher` contract](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher).
