Why do some networks—like Facebook’s graph—seem to _drift_ into irrelevance over time? Putting the product’s (ever-crowded) feature set aside, I think there’s a more fundamental assumption baked into services today causing this: all edges (friendships, follows, subscriptions, etc.) between nodes existing _indefinitely_. Sure, you can always unfriend, unfollow, or unsubscribe from accounts that are no longer of interest. But, these actions aren’t _encouraged_. This is a bit counterintuitive. By dissuading users from pruning their graphs, services boost short-term “metrics,” at the risk of causing the network and reality to diverge—eventually leading to churn altogether. Concretely, the combination of my FB feed containing posts from folks I’ve been out of touch with and the [weight of the verb](/ambient-intimacy#network-nomenclature) “unfriending” causes the network’s snapshot of my social reality to become increasingly inaccurate. It’s healthy for my inner circle to _change_ over time; FB (indirectly) makes it feel unhealthy through the connotation of “unfriending.” Let’s call this gap between a system’s model of reality and reality itself “digital drift.”

After giving the concept a name, I’ve noticed it crop up everywhere. To-do apps are another instance. At their core, they attempt to model the state of the tasks we need to accomplish. However, without regular upkeep, they go stale in being able to answer the question “what should I be working on right now?“—causing a loss of trust in the system.

How can services mitigate digital drift? Two approaches come to mind: periodic “reality reconciliations” and malleability.

Reality reconciliations are _deliberate_ attempts to update a system’s model of the world. These attempts can either be explicitly encouraged or taken on the user’s accord. [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) does a wonderful job at encouraging the former. Each project within the task management system can be assigned a “review” cadence.

Reviews are then prompted at the chosen interval, allowing users to groom tasks within a project. By reconciling items in OmniFocus and reality, it’s easier to trust the system—opening the app isn’t met with irrelevant cruft, but rather a snapshot that better approximates your life.

[Rosemary Donahue](https://twitter.com/rosadona) (somewhat hilariously) provided an example of user initiated reality reconciliation in her post: “[The Strange Reason I Love Facebook Birthday Notifications](https://hellogiggles.com/love-sex/friends/love-facebook-notifications-unfriend/).” On birthdays of folks she no longer considers friends, she quietly unfriends them—the ol’ Facebook Irish Goodbye. This may seem harsh, but Rosemary elaborates on how it “make[s] space…for the things I really care about, and that includes digital space.”

> “It may sound heartless, to unfriend people on their birthday, but I like to think that they won’t notice I’ve done it on a day that other people—presumably, people they’re still in touch with—are showering their timeline with love, affection, and, of course, GIFs. While I know that I could simply unfollow rather than unfriend on Facebook…, I don’t understand the need to keep up digital pretenses…I prefer to leave people’s Internet lives the same way I leave parties: quietly, with no goodbyes, and perhaps with a few snacks in my pocket.”

OmniFocus Reviews and Rosemary’s approach gently counteract digital drift. Still, these forms of reconciliation feel like half-steps and require nontrivial effort, which brings us to a way around that: malleability.

## Malleability

- Messaging platforms seem to approximate this by sorting threads by recency. Of course, there’s an inherit bias here, as it prioritizes recency over longer-term friends, loved ones, and relatives we may talk to longer, more infrequent timescales.
- Finite Edges, e.g. following an account for _X_ months (say, they’re covering a conference)
- Acknowledge there is an ounce of social awkwardness here, but it’s more honest.
- Mention about algorithmic feeds and how this feels a bit like a Band-Aid (lifts the inner circle as a sort of iceberg, I’d rather just have a smaller graph in the first place)
- Mention of Shipper’s Latent Serendipity of keeping older edges around

The best services mirror reality and digital drift is a trailing indicator of that mirror being broken.
