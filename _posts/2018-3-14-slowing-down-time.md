There’s no dancing around it—we all have a finite number of heartbeats, breaths, and seconds on this planet (and potentially Mars). However, the curious thing about time is its elastic nature. Never-ending high school summers. Days so long they had seasons. One-on-one’s that stall when you ask for a raise. Assuming we’re not moving near the speed of light, time marches forwards at a constant rate. It’s our _perceptions_ of it that change. I’ve become fascinated with ways to slow down this perception.

We’ll cover three aspects that appear to be at play: new experiences, busy minds, and tempo.

## New Experiences

When everyday routines aren’t punctuated by newer experiences such as travel, different schedules, or novel tasks, we shift into autopilot. We’ve all been there. A friend will ask how your week went and, after pausing to reflect, the past few days resemble a blurred stretch of time. This dynamic is typically attributed to spending time in “System One” of thought. Daniel Kahneman presents the duality between System One and Two in the notorious tome: “[Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).” At a high level, the first mode is reserved for low-energy cognitive tasks; those that are “fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, or _unconscious_.” Examples include commutes, performing pre-computed arithmetic (`10 * 10 = ?`), or finishing trite phrases (“To be, or…”). The second mode is more effortful and _conscious_. Newer experiences, performing an unfamiliar exercise, or following a math proof all land in this bucket. A second-order effect of these modes is a dilation of time. Our perception of time seems to contract when the unconscious thoughts of System One string together. On the flip side, the neurogenerative nature of System Two makes us more aware of the gaps between thoughts, dilating that perception.

Surfaced awareness of thought gaps brings us to the next topic—how busy our minds are.

## Busy Minds

I firmly believe that a busy mind accelerates the passage of time. Constant context switching, obsessive rumination, and other forms of mental load not only shorten the space between thoughts, but also [inhibit our capacity for originality](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/opinion/sunday/think-less-think-better.html). How do we remedy this? The answer might involve allocating uninterrupted spans of time to experience boredom, let the dust in our minds settle, and get into flow.

Boredom hit hard during my first, week-long, silent retreat. I hesitate to include this anecdote, since describing the experience might alter my relationship with it or be interpreted as a latent [form of signaling](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/972274896486223872). But, I aim to honestly distill it here, in hope that it helps folks, like me, whose insatiable information diet has made boredom a privilege.

Seven days without reading, writing, speaking, or direct eye contact (one of the retreat rules) made me realize how rarely I get bored during everyday New York Life. It got to the point where I would take longer showers just to read the label on my shampoo bottle—yikes. Around the third day, I began shifting my appetite for mental stimulation towards paying attention to what was around me. I vividly remember spending 45 minutes staring at a tree on Wednesday evening—letting my focus wander from root to leaves and back in some sort of mental Brownian motion. The remainder of the retreat contained the slowest days of my life, in the most palatable sense. I was reminded that time moves at a glacial pace when we’re present to soak in the world around us.

This _isn’t_ to say we should be present at all times. Going on autopilot during commutes or chores might better allow us to deploy our attention towards experiences we want to magnify. Another instance where speeding up time is desirable is flow. It usually occurs when [thinking and presence](/thinking-about-thinking) are in harmony. When you’re so in tune with the task at hand, that your sense of space and time is lost.

Tangentially, a lot of the discussion around being present is framed as a deliberate, _additive_ behavior—a Presence Hat you put on from time to time. I’m starting to question whether this is accurate. For me, resting in awareness, without distraction, let’s the dust settle. What if we’re innately present and the trick is giving ourselves enough space and time to realize this?

## Tempo

Tempo has a (non)relation to time in a couple of domains: music and clocks.

### Music

Music backgrounds the entirety of my days. Between wearing headphones at work to turning on speakers at the apartment, I’m constantly listening to house and trance. These genres are marked by differences in beats per minute (bpm) ranges with house clocking in at 120–130 bpm and trance at 110–150. This got me wondering if bpm ranges impacted time perception. After [asking on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/786961355962257409), I was pointed to [a study from 1998](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0305735698261007) on tempo and time perception in a gymnasium setting (emphasis mine).

> “Fast or slow music was played in [a] gymnasium [for] two consecutive days, and as [the participants] left, [they] were informed of their time of entry and asked to estimate the present time. The results showed that musical tempo _did not influence_ time duration estimates in any one particular direction, but that slow music led to a greater degree of _inaccuracy_ in estimations than did fast music.”

Despite a lack of influence between tempo and time duration estimates, it’s interesting that slower music increased variability in those estimates.

### Clocks

Tempo is also embedded in the measurement of time itself. I’ve noticed a few alternative approaches to clocks, which seem to have side effects on time perception.

#### Chromachron

The Chromachron is a physical manifestation of synesthesia. Opting for “Color Time”—a literal translation of Chromachron—the “anti-stress watch is [praised for its inability to display the exact time](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/chromachron-a-radically-new-approach-to-time).”

> “Two Chromachron watches over the 1976 booklet ‘The Story of Color Time.’” Image credit to [HODINKEE](https://www.hodinkee.com).

The watch face is split into a dozen colors, with “each [matching] the hour for which it stands, both in terms of illumination and energy. [Which] explains the shining yellow for noon, while the afternoon gets increasingly darker colors as the sun fades away. It also applies to the morning, with brighter colors as the sun rises. This system takes some time to get used to, but it definitely brings a more zen feeling to the reading of time. As minutes fade away, it teaches you to envision your schedule in a more relaxed way.”

The black center slows the “tempo” of our perception by providing an hour-wide slice into the current time. Instead of seeing the minutes or seconds pass by, we can only notice subtler shifts in color—making me curious if these widened intervals trigger the tendency towards inaccurate (and more relaxed) time perceptions shown in the aforementioned gymnasium study.

#### 24-Hour Time

While the Chromachron has 12 colors, it still folds a calendar day into “a.m.” and “p.m.” I’ve [tried switching to military time](/24-hour-time) and it allowed me to better grasp the length of a day. The division, modulo 12, provides a two-beat tempo for the hours in a day—which could shorten our time perception. There’s a palpable length of time that using “13” over “1 p.m.” conveys. The rest of the world probably made the right call on this format.

#### Without Time

What if we threw out clocks altogether? Doing so would certainly be utopian and make coordination nearly impossible. Still, I believe there’s a case for regimenting stretches of time to _not know_ what time it is. David Cain meditated on this in his “[Case For Not Knowing What Time It Is](http://www.raptitude.com/2017/09/the-case-for-not-knowing-what-time-it-is/)”

> “As I’ve hidden and disabled the clocks around me, the days seem to flow better. Without question, I’m more efficient with my time, even though I’m unsure of exactly how much of it goes where. It simply feels healthier to operate with the vague sense that it’s mid-morning than to know it’s 10:24.

> …Checking the clock does more than just supply information. It connects, in our mind’s eye, what we’re doing now to everything else that must be done later. Seeing the numerical time draws our attention away from the task at hand and into the abstract realm of planning, scheduling and evaluation.”

Cain concludes with a hypothetical parallel to blood pressure measurements being prominently displayed throughout the day, as we do with clocks:

> “Imagine if you couldn’t easily avoid knowing your current blood pressure numbers. Wherever you go, there are readouts everywhere: on towers, buildings, entertainment devices and appliances. You see it within seconds of waking, and last thing before bed.

> Obviously it can be useful to have access to your blood pressure numbers. But if you received 80 blood pressure updates a day, it would be considerably harder to enjoy your life. You’d spend so much time in health-evaluation mode that you’d be unable to enjoy so much as a restaurant meal without wondering what your actions mean for the big picture.

> There’s an analogous psychological cost to constantly learning what time it is. Whenever we see the time, we often can’t help but remember our whole basket of obligations and goals, and wonder how we’re ever going to fit them all together. And how often do we feel completely confident in our ability to do that?”

There likely isn’t a perfect, _universal_ congruence between tempo—or lack thereof in Cain’s case—and our perception of time. In fact, tempo is so important for humans that we [ritualized weekdays](https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/934671385485381632). Yet, we can still be deliberate in picking intervals to maintain a healthy relationship with the abstract grid that overlays our existence.

Our tour of new experiences, busy minds, and tempo has shown that the escalator of time already moves slowly—we’re the ones sprinting up it. Perhaps, slowing down time means finding a tempo that provides just enough routine, while allowing us to notice the infinite, green glow between the gaps of that escalator. After all, our perception of time is the sum of these gaps.
