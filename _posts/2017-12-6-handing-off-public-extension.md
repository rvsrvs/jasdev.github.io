Firing off the first tweet for [@PublicExtension](https://twitter.com/PublicExtension) on October 9th, 2015 was a rush. I was on the tail end of my batch at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), after having spent the [previous quarter transitioning](/one-month-at-recurse-center) from an backend engineer to writing Swift every day. The goal was to regularly post extensions I‚Äôve come up with, stumbled upon, or received from the community. In the span of a year, I collected 89 extensions, had [countless conversations](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/767781639837609984) with the Core Team, and even [represented the account at XOXO Festival](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKIGsJvjg74).

However, I (accidentally) treated Public Extension like a ‚Äú[Forever Project](https://dianaberlin.com/posts/no-more-forever-projects).‚Äù Without an end in sight, the weight of ‚Äúdo I just keep running this account ad infinitum‚Äù caused missed days to turn into weeks, and weeks into a year of hibernation. My energy drifted elsewhere. [Writing](/), [building out](/crafting-space) Peloton‚Äôs iOS team, and [crafting memories](https://www.instagram.com/p/BU5jrpRgmeW) with friends on two wheels. Until a couple of weeks ago, I had almost forgotten about the project when Joe‚Äîcommonly aliased as [@mergesort](https://twitter.com/mergesort)‚Äîexpressed interest in taking the baton.

I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better fit. Not only is Joe a [great friend](https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=from%3Ajasdev%20%40mergesort&src=typd) who is 1000% game to [volley Swift puns](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/776210727078092800), but he also has a track record of helping, advising, and guiding folks in the iOS community. A lunch, [repository transfer](https://github.com/mergesort/Public-Extension), and a few iMessages later, Public Extension has a second wind. Joe and I have discussed some of his early plans for the account and I‚Äôm stoked. Please give him the same [support](https://twitter.com/parrots/status/779014268905816064) and [cheers](https://twitter.com/jakemarsh/status/652543263690199040) y‚Äôall have kindly given me along the first leg of PE‚Äôs relay. Below are some notes about the transition and aspects that will remain the same:

- To prevent old commit permalinks from breaking, we [transferred the repository](https://github.com/mergesort/Public-Extension) to Joe‚Äôs GitHub account and [I forked it](https://github.com/Jasdev/Public-Extension). This means that all of the old tweets can safely be embedded.
- The account wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without submissions. Going forward, all extensions will _continue_ to link back to the original author, if applicable and with permission.
- On the note of submissions, they will still be accepted üíô Joe can provide more details on preferred ways to do so.
