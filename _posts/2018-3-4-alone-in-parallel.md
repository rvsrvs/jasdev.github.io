An often-forgotten aspect of “being alone” is the backdrop in which it takes place. On one end of the spectrum, we have isolation—[Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden)-esque retreats or withdrawing to our apartments after a full day; on the other end, there’s the intriguing dynamic of being alone _amongst_ company. Cities are incredible at fostering this. A favorite New York Saturday tradition of mine is floating from coffee shop to coffee shop—time to be alone in parallel with the city.

More broadly, the concept of simultaneously individual, yet shared experiences has many embeddings (don’t worry, we won’t be covering silent discos). I want to explore a few personal attempts and how they’ve been a sort-of litmus test for how close I am with someone.

Funnily enough, it served as my musical backdrop while writing.
