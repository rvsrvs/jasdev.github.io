# Upon Further Reflection

Reflection—

whether through six years of daily journal entries, two years of weekly email checkins, or four years of monthly(_-ish_) posts at [_Distillations_](https://jasdev.me)

—has been an unbroken mirror in my life.

And those are the intentional forms. An agreed-upon, yet-never-explicitly-stated law of product development is “a service either shuts down or lives long enough to add a ‘Here’s what you did [_n - 1_ years ago](https://jasdev.me/nostalgia)’ feature.” Constantly being reminded—inadvertently or not—of our timestamped selves embedded in the services we use is almost expected.

This isn’t to wax poetic (the wax already melted if we’re being honest, and we are). I’m tired of seeing my reflection in a home screen of mirrors.

I admitted this to myself when considering therapy, again. I regularly saw a therapist back when I moved—read crash landed, emotionally—to New York in ’15. It got me out of that rut and into the parts of my life I cherish today. Yet, the _cadence_ with which I introspect either deliberately—with essays, checkins, and journaling—or inadvertently—with `Photos.app`’s “One Year Ago” feature or the ghost of my “fitter” self on Peloton’s leaderboard—makes me hesitant to add _another_ metaphorical mirror. If it’s possible to introspect to the point where I’m hesitant to do so in therapy…yep.

I’ve never questioned the notion of creating “better” versions of our selves through reflection or the like. It’s even on my about page:

> I’m an engineer and writer in New York. Outside of Distillations, I spend my time cycling, listening to dance music, and building products that help us build better versions of ourselves.

These days, I wonder if over reflection creates a kind of carbon copy of the self—i.e. the “Journal Jasdev” or “Essay Jasdev”—shifting my focus away from my actual, well, _carbon_ self.

More generally, the written copy on the platforms we use don’t help. Posts are underscored with “_X_ days ago” to encourage maintaining a sort of reflective cadence. Not posting somewhat implies a lack of presence, which might point at a flaw [in the mechanics](https://twitter.com/maxkreminski/status/1030838962191982592) governing today’s services. Are we posting—and reflecting—to be “seen” in digital space, even though we’re present in meatspace?

This tendency is normalizing with the return of newsletters. Not only are Sunday’s [spent reading them](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson/status/1097300084465811456). They’re also (often) spent apologizing for failing to send out last Sunday’s (it’s Okay to start a weekly newsletter only to realize, later, a monthly, later later, or, whenever you can cadence works better). We’ve seemingly forgotten that an absence of our Newsletter Self doesn’t mean we don’t exist.

Relatedly, the Other Self planted in major platforms is the basis of the ad-targeting model. Rob Horning put this well in a recent thread:

> [The shadow version of you that Facebook creates is its property; it’s what’s targeted. Meanwhile that entity is used against you (it’s used to determine what you’re qualified to see), which intensifies pressure on us to adopt that as our “real self.”](https://twitter.com/robhorning/status/1088852269989351426)

In a sense, targeting is an attempt to close the gap between our selves and a lagging approximation of it—with the frequency of gap closings being what classifies us as [(M, W, or D)AUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users).

Beholding myself (or being beholden to) daily, weekly, monthly reflections might be why I’m exhausted of it…and I’m starting to believe there isn’t a right cadence, either. At best, reflection will always be an imprint of a past self.

Fingers crossed my future self remembers that.
