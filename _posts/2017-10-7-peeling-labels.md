With my first anniversary at [Peloton](http://onepeloton.com) approaching, I’ve been thinking about how labels and titles shape internal narratives. Reflecting on my career and the various jobs I’ve held, I realized that the way the industry talks about jobs, and to some extent ourselves, needs to shift. For example, my online bios _used_ to follow the cookie-cutter [“X at Y. Previously A, B, and C.”](/x-at-y-previously-a-b-c) template, where `X` is some title, and `{Y, A, B, C}` are companies. This template has since been consciously refactored to [“__building__ Y…“](http://spoonbill.io/datum/149497/). I have way more to offer than the ceiling under which “iOS Engineer” places me. The intent here isn’t external validation, but rather to be intellectually honest about whether the labels I hold—voluntarily or involuntarily—are the _right ones_ and peeling off the ones that _don’t fit_ anymore. Let’s explore this nuance a bit.

## The Power of Labels

Why introspect labels in the first place? Because they often have implicit power in affecting [internal dialogues](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/figuring-out-how-and-why-we-talk-to-ourselves/508487/). Ancestrally, humans rely on the security that fixed traits provide, especially with regard to identity and labels for a sense of control. For instance, let’s break down the label of being introverted. “I am an introvert.“ “I’ve _always_ been on the introverted side.” Typically, introversion comes across something that one “has,” as if it were some sort of possession held _indefinitely_<sup>1</sup>. I’ve tried to look at it from a [slightly different lens](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/831682922704945152). “I (occasionally) need time to be on my own.” The latter is more __malleable__ and hints at [introversion being a function of our social activity](/thoughts/2017-1-2) instead of a _fixed_ trait.

Moreover, a second-order effect of labels is narrowing/expanding expectations. Consider the earlier “iOS Engineer” example. While the “iOS“ prefix seems benign in the context of [a](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/your-culture-is-rotting/) [great](https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info-culture) [culture](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/04/16/making-small-culture-changes/), it could _accidentally_ carve an invisible sphere of expectation around an engineer __in a company with mediocre values__. If she wanted to contribute to the backend codebase, that team might gatekeep contributions with less-welcoming scrutiny. Make no mistake, the root issue at hand in this example is a __lack of sound company values__, but sticking with broader labels such as “engineer” can shatter these invisible spheres and encourage cross-team interaction and ownership.

## Spotting (And Questioning) Labels

I find that half the effort in adjusting labels, narratives, and beliefs I hold are _noticing them in the first place_. [Mental noting](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/11/04/noting-technique-video/) has been vital here. At its core, noting involves gently<sup>2</sup> applying a tag (e.g. “feeling”, “thinking“, etc.) to a thought when it arises in the mind. Doing so creates a sort of _distance_ from it and can reveal patterns of thought. Taking this a step further, it’s been helpful to reflect on whether or not a pattern is doing harm. I’m not advocating judging one’s thoughts, but instead being truthful with oneself in questioning them. 

A prompt I’ve used—which has lead to many pregnant pauses—is “who am I _without_ this label, narrative, or belief?” As a concrete example, this question has helped me avoid conflating media narratives about 2017 with my own:

## Identity Minimization

There's a concept in physics that objects have a moment of inertia. An item’s “moment” is proportional to its particles’ mass and distance from an axis of rotation. The larger an object’s moment, the _harder_ it is to rotate. This is why figure skaters bring their arms inward when going for faster spins; it _lowers_ their moment of inertia. Why take this digression? Because I _think_ there might be an analog here for the labels we hold. That is, I’ve noticed when I cling onto many labels it is _harder for me to change_. This lends itself to a sort of “identity minimization.” The fewer boxes I pack myself into, the more readily I’ll be able to unpack any situation that comes my way.

## If I’m More Than an “iOS Engineer,” What Am I?

I’m still sitting with this question. For now, I’m _personally_ content with “Building Peloton.” But, this is super<sup>ambiguous</sup> in the workplace (and when it comes to pay grades). “Product engineer” could be fitting, given that I spend a lot of time in our users’ shoes (literally, I try to clip into the bike a couple of times a week to experience Peloton’s touch points).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My new hobby is to attend random group fitness classes in NYC to see how we can better improve Peloton 😏</p>&mdash; Jasdev Singh (@jasdev) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/852130577461465089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But, I hope to eventually delineate our company’s strategy—at an executive level—to help users build better versions of themselves. So, I’ll likely have to reevaluate my upcoming label if/when I get there.

Culturally, we tend to espouse “holding“ onto things, from labels, beliefs, narratives, and values. However, it’s been helpful for me to occasionally take a step back and remember that these shouldn’t be treated as possessions held indefinitely. Learning to shed those labels doing a disservice is almost as valuable as forming them in the first place. After all, we change year over year. Our personal frames of reference should too.

<sup>1</sup>: The finiteness of (some) labels are often _forgotten_. This crops up a lot in mental health. Chemical forms of common conditions aside, it’s tempting to unquestioningly conclude “I __have__ X or Y.” A more helpful narrative _might_ be “I’m going through {a rough patch, a period of stress, etc.}.” This relinquishes the power of X/Y in being some condition held _ad infinitum_ and can provide a much-needed ounce of agency.

<sup>2</sup>: A tip that [Andy Puddicombe](https://twitter.com/andypuddicombe) espouses in Headspace is that noting isn’t meant to be _exhaustive_. Racing to label every thought is a losing battle. It’s way easier for me to sit with the ones that stick around.
