title: Are We Moving Too Fast?

I remember the sprint planning meeting so clearly. I had [joined Peloton](http://spoonbill.io/datum/81425/) the week prior and the team was heads-down trying to launch a major refactor of the [iOS app](https://www.pelotoncycle.com/ios). After calculating how many story points we were going to tackle in the next sprint, our project manager, [Asma Khan](https://www.facebook.com/PelotonCycle/photos/a.436836049742545.1073741825.276454582447360/1024831050943039/?type=1&theater), asked the group: “are we moving too fast?”

I’ll never forget this question. In my three years in the industry so far (sans internships), this was the first time I was asked to reflect on our pace potentially being _too fast_. [Agile Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) centers on a major interval training metaphor, namely __sprints__. But, Agile almost entirely misses the other side of the coin: regimented rest. We can’t expect teams to knock out a monotonically increasing amount of story points, sprint after sprint. Sometimes, you have to move slower now to move faster later.

[Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval) recently posted a great perspective on the Athlete ⇔ Knowledge Worker metaphor:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes - train and sprint, then rest and reassess.</p>&mdash; Naval Ravikant (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/873624849230385152">June 10, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I hope the next wave of development paradigms borrow from what we’ve learned in training world-class athletes[^1]. To list a few: [sound bodies make for sound minds](/one-month-at-recurse-center#energy-management), [sleep deprivation is a false badge of honor](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/796846867971645440)[^2], [information diets are akin to nutritional diets](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html), [managers should also aim to be coaches (teachers)](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/06/01/479335421/practice-makes-possible-what-we-learn-by-studying-amazing-kids), and [being comfortable with being uncomfortable is a skill we can cultivate](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/06/how-exercise-shapes-you-far-beyond-the-gym.html).
