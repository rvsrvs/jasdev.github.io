_The word cycles through my life_.

Pun aside, I chose the phrasing specifically. I work at Peloton, whose flagship product was its bike (and now the [Tread](https://www.onepeloton.com/tread)). “Cadence” tops my list of future kid names. And, the engineering community keeps cadence with its half-honored borrowing of the “sprints” metaphor from athletics—where work is compressed into two-week sprints staggered one after another, quarter over quarter. The odd part? Engineering forgot the second half of the athletics metaphor: rest periods.

_The word increasingly cycles through others’ lives_.

As we move away from The Feed[^1], we’re in charge of our cadences, instead of having the pace at which friends, news, and Content® are surfaced chosen for us. [Sundays are spent _reading_ newsletters](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson/status/1097300084465811456). They’re also often spent apologizing for failing to _send_ out last Sunday’s. 



Are we posting because we need to be “seen” in digital space? 

Keeping cadence to get going. Letting it go once we’ve built a foundation. Spending more time _listening_. Not posting on a platform doesn’t mean you’re not _present_. Why “lurkers” aren’t bad. If we’re all talking, who is listening?
