_The word cycles through my life_.

Pun aside, I chose the phrasing specifically. I work at Peloton, whose flagship product was its bike (and now the [Tread](https://www.onepeloton.com/tread)). “Cadence” tops my list of future kid names[^1]. And, the engineering community keeps cadence with its half-honored borrowing of the “sprints” metaphor from athletics—where work is compressed into two-week sprints staggered one after another, quarter over quarter[^2].

_The word increasingly cycles through others’ lives_.

As we move away from The Feed[^3], we’re in charge of our cadences, instead of having the pace at which friends, news, and Content® are surfaced chosen for us. Sundays are [spent reading newsletters](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson/status/1097300084465811456). They’re also spent apologizing for failing to send out last Sunday’s.

_Maybe it’s time to reevaluate our association with the word._

Am I writing monthly over at [_Distillations_ ](https://jasdev.me) to be “seen” in digital space, even though I hold presence in meatspace? Am I tweeting about seven times a day—17.6k tweets over seven years—because there’s something to say or am I maintaining a sort of external pulse? Was my sports hernia an unlucky injury or a side effect of overtraining to avoid [Breaking the Streak](https://zachholman.com/posts/streaks/)? 

This isn’t to unilaterally disavow cadence. It serves a purpose. Keeping cadence helps build a foundation, whether it be a writing, gym, or posting habit. Yet, once that foundation is built, it’s healthy to spot check and, if needed, break stride. The copy on the services we use don’t often help. Posts are underscored with “_X_ days ago” timestamps that encourage “talking” over “listening” (the latter often being called “lurking”). I hope the narrative around letting go of a cadence to spend more time listening becomes common. Not posting doesn’t imply a lack of presence, which might point at a flaw in the mechanics governing today’s social media platforms. If we’re all talking, who’s listening?

We don’t have to permanently bucket ourselves into [(M, W, or D)AU’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users) and should instead maintain individual paces. Being in control of our feeds—whether through reverse chronological, newsletters, or RSS—is a step forward. Still, we shouldn’t lock ourselves into daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, or yearly or (some of other stride length) in perpetuity. Put another way,

_The first order of cadence gets us going. The second order of cadence—the cadence of cadence, itself—isn’t so well defined._ 

And that’s probably for the better. Maybe Cadence, my future child, not the word, will come across this someday.
