Since moving to New York City, I‚Äôve spent ~257 hours commuting to and from work via [the F line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_(New_York_City_Subway_service))[^1]. While I used to dread my commute, I‚Äôve recently spent a lot of time thinking about how to make it more enjoyable. The goal **wasn‚Äôt to optimize every minute of my commute**, but rather to make it something I looked forward to, while aligning with my [core value of always learning](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/97c505fa1cd52e74060fc898d0f20f3206347164/core-values.md#L5).

The substrate for this reflection was [Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/uint_min)‚Äôs note about the privilege of spare time in open-source development at the end of ‚Äú[On Becoming a (Compiler) Wizard](http://belkadan.com/blog/2016/05/So-You-Want-To-Be-A-Compiler-Wizard/).‚Äù The last point really hit home for me.

> I want to explicitly recognize this as a form of **privilege**. The people most likely to have spare time to do outside projects are people
>
> - who don‚Äôt have families to take care of (kids, parents, whatever)
>
> - who have a good, steady income (i.e. not learning while, say, balancing two part-time jobs)
>
> - who live close to work (minimizing a commute)

Spending 70 minutes each day commuting doesn‚Äôt have to be a sunk cost. Below are some ways I‚Äôve tried to view commutes through a more fruitful lens.

## Disconnection

One of my favorite hobbies is to observe subway riders instinctively pulling out their phones upon resurfacing or arriving at a stop. I realize that most of these impulses can be traced back to [messaging loved ones](/always-on-conversations)[^2], but I find that a large percentage of my urges to check my phone[^3] are usually aimless. To combat this, I periodically challenge myself to keep my phone in my pocket (on Airplane Mode) for the entire ride. This seems trivial. But, it‚Äôs challenging when we condition ourselves to be heads down in Instapaper queues and Twitter timelines. Scoping out a bit, the notion of being idle for extended periods of time[^4] has become increasingly rare, as my friend [Ryan](http://twitter.com/ryandawidjan) noted in his [thought journal](https://quip.com/jgBUALiGBjwp):

> It just occured to me that if someone is simply waiting for you and doing nothing [with] their phone/hands when you arrive, you either think they‚Äôre mad at you [or up to something].

While underground routes facilitate disconnection from the Internet, there is a tangible dose of inspiration that comes with above-ground lines (especially in New York).

## Small Gains with AM and PM ‚ÄúSplits‚Äù

While working full-time affords you freedoms that are absent from schooling, an aspect I miss the most from university is the‚Äúmandatory [mental] exercise periods."[^5]

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hated school as a kid, but at 46, a disciplined study of multiple subjects with a mandatory exercise period sounds... kind of nice.</p>‚Äî John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/775310858058469379">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Because of this, I‚Äôve tried to use my morning commute as dedicated time to improve myself in some way (reserving the evening for disconnection). This is a practice I [take to heart](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/7b2d5327bad2aeb3d7ac353356f9e2bddef68583/daily-list.md#L8). Every so often, I unfavorably fall into a routine of starting my days in a *reactive* manner[^6] (i.e. checking notifications upon waking up, not allowing enough time before work to write, read, etc.). This defers my personal ambitions until after work, which enables tiredness or social obligations to take priority. **While these aren‚Äôt bad things**, it causes a cycle in which no time is left for growth outside of the office.

[Ayaka Nonaka](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon), my friend, encapsulated this idea in her [post on daily routines](http://blog.ayaka.me/post/137497360302/daily-routine):

> Setting aside time in the morning to work on something that is *just for me* has been the most impactful thing I‚Äôve started doing for myself. **I wake up for myself**.

Below are some things I do during my morning commute:

- Read my ‚ÄúDaily List‚Äù
  - [More on this habit](/daily-list) and my [current list](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blob/master/daily-list.md)

- Podcasts
  - I manage my subscriptions with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/).

- Read
  - Usually a book or my [Instapaper Queue](http://instapaper.com/p/jasdev)[^7]. I‚Äôm trying to strike a better balance between short and long-form content. But, that‚Äôs for another post! [Scott Young](https://twitter.com/scotthyoung/) has a fantastic [comparison of the two](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/01/16/blogs-vs-books/).

- Meditation
  - I always feel a bit awkward meditating on the train, but [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com)‚Äôs ‚ÄúCommuting‚Äù exercise is my go-to.

- Writing
  - Morning Pages
    - [Chris Winfield](https://twitter.com/chriswinfield) has a detailed [overview of the practice](http://www.chriswinfield.com/morning-pages/), but at a high-level, it entails writing ~750 words, usually by hand, without stopping. __Think cache invalidation for your mind__.

  - Thank You Letters
    - To better [practice going first](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/97c505fa1cd52e74060fc898d0f20f3206347164/core-values.md#L8), I started randomly writing letters to my family, friends, mentors, and others who have impacted my life in some way, no matter how small. The reactions to them have been beyond heart warming. Moreover, [Patrick Collison](https://twitter.com/patrickc) recently summarized his experience with this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It‚Äôs like a paper-based, unidirectional, asynchronous version of Twitter in which you only say nice things.</p>‚Äî Patrick Collison (@patrickc) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/717086681719922688">April 4, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Turning off ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù

We‚Äôve all been there. After hopping on the train, beginning a walk, or driving a car, the actual act of traveling fades to the background, only snapping out of *autopilot* upon reaching your destination. This is typically referred to as a transition to [System 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems) of thought, which is primed for rote tasks like commuting. After reading [Katie Zhu](https://twitter.com/ktzhu)‚Äôs post, ‚Äú[Walk on the Other Side of the Street](https://ktzine.com/walk-on-the-other-side-of-the-street-be803c8f55cb#.h11156bkk),‚Äù I‚Äôve tried to be more deliberate about anchoring my attention[^8]. She describes the wonder of _perceiving what you see_:

> There‚Äôs so much that we have to tune out in order to stay sane or be able to just, you know, generally function. But it‚Äôs a nice reminder every now and then to take the time to actually see, look at your surroundings, the routine, boring shit you write off because it‚Äôs not novel or exciting anymore. Sometimes, it‚Äôll surprise you.

Doing so has the side-effect of slowing down one‚Äôs perception of time[^9].

These are just a few of the thoughts that have bubbled up after commuting for the past year. Looking back, it‚Äôs hard to find a cohesive narrative that threads them together. But, maybe that‚Äôs the beauty of it. Commuting is an unstructured block in the day that one can mold to their liking.

[^4]: Aside from meditation, which is more intentional

[^5]: Or homework, projects, etc., for lack of a better phrase
