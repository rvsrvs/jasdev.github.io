A common sticking point that meditators face when catching themselves lost in thought is _thinking about thinking_. For example:

- I’ll [mentally note](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/11/04/noting-technique-video/) that I’m ruminating on a past experience.
- Instead of returning to the present, I’ll accidentally __think about__ the note I just made.
	- Getting lost in thought isn’t necessarily bad. However, it’s important to know when doing so is causing a disservice.
- Then, I’ll think about the aforementioned thinking.
- The process usually recurses a few levels. That is, I’ll think about the thinking…about the thinking.

“Thinking about thinking” throws off longtime meditators because their acute awareness can _sometimes_ be a crutch in causing them to lean into thought. I encountered this during a [retreat in May](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/824997535483826176)[^1]. However, during office hours with [Jonathan](http://jonathanfoust.com/about/), we attempted to bucket the states our mind can be in, as a way to _flatten_ any potential meta-thinking.

![Two states of mind: thinking and being present](/public/images/states_of_mind.png)

In the above division, one is either present or thinking[^2]. If we assume that these two states are _mutually exclusive_ (I’ll touch on the potential intersection in a moment), then “thinking about (thinking about…) thinking” gets reduced to, well, _just thinking_!

Can you think and be present concurrently? My gut says the intersection of these states is what we typically refer to as [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). When you’re so in tune with a task at hand, that everything else takes the backseat.

It seems contradictory that I’m regarding these states as being mutually exclusive when I want to prevent “thinking about thinking,” but allowing them to intersect when it comes to flow. [Nick Szabo](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4) calls this holding of contradictory possibilities “[quantum thinking](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2012/07/more-short-takes.html)” (fourth bullet point).

> […] You should disagree with yourself. Totalitarian thought asks us to consider, much less accept, only one hypothesis at a time. By contrast quantum thought, […] demands that we [simultaneously] consider often mutually contradictory possibilities.

The thinking/present distinction is the first instance of quantum thought I’ve come across, since reading their post. I’m still processing this thought. But, it’s been in my stream of consciousness for a couple of weeks now, so I wanted to commit it to prose.
