iOS 12’s “[Screen Time](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/)“ might be the biggest, recent step forward in humane product design.

It packs usage reports, device pickup counts, enhanced Do Not Disturb controls, and granular notification settings. Yet, as I read the press release, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the feature is an OS-level Band-Aid over the networks called out—Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, et al.

Fixing our collective relationship with these networks won’t happen over night and I’m not advocating for their absence. However, they might benefit from replicating aspects of _slower_ networks such as blogging, journaling, and RSS (more generally). Specifically, decoupling reading and writing, preventing traditional notions of “engagement” at the protocol level, allowing users to siphon content into an orbit that works for them.

- Almost purely write-only, reserving reflection for longer timescales
- Reminds me of the old letters to ourselves high school teachers would tuck away and mail to us in university

## Decoupling Writing and Reading

- What if we bake this assumption at the protocol-level?
- Specific times to read and write?
	- Capture the joy of shared presence on Twitter

## The Red Herring that is Time Tracking

- How a service punctuates your day is almost more important than the wall time you spend on it

## Siphoning from Oceans into Ponds

- Siphoning oceans to smaller ponds (Instapaper)
	- Read when you’re ready.

- Content orbits
- Qualm with Stories _forcing_ an orbit’s period

- Importance of Creation and Consumption
	- An implicit assumption we make with feeds is that we have to both read and write (post) to it. However, this conjunction doesn’t always have to be true. After all, we’re the users of these services! Historically, Twitter has been criticized for its inability to convert lurkers into avid Tweeters. However, this can be a blessing in disguise, especially at a personal level. Reversing this, I use Swarm and GitHub as write-only feeds. I’ll checkin and commit, respectively, but rarely browse their feeds. I believe there is an opportunity for a service to use this decoupling to its advantage, as I noted in my previous post, “Nostalgia and Upper Bounds.“
	- [I]magine if services like Twitter allowed tweets to be posted at any time, and only surfaced the feed during specific, limited hours of the day. That could do wonders in eradicating continuous partial attention.
- RSS maybe may be “dead“ for all mainstream purposes (aside from quietly powering the podcast industry), but I’m a holdout. The Web seems to oscillate between algorithmic and raw feeds (e.g., RSS) and we’re currently on the upswing of the former. However, what’s special about RSS is its postal system-like nature. Feed entries arrive at a digestible pace and the protocol prevents any typical notion of “engagement.“ No likes, RTs, or comments. Posts simply float out into the ether. Following my friends on both Twitter and RSS has been fascinating because of this. More specifically, when feed items aren’t cross-posted to normal social channels, it’s a small glimpse into their digital inner life.
