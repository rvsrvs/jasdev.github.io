Electronic Dance Music is a [big part of my life](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/pubs/unbound/spr14/singh.php)[^1]. Unlike other genres, tracks and remixes are released at a breakneck pace. Because of this, artists tend to gravitate towards Twitter-esque services for music like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh), where (re)posting multiple songs a day is common. I‚Äôve spent years curating tracks on the service to the point where my _local_ music library is only a handful of albums‚Äîaround four hours worth‚Äîthat have [attached themselves to memories](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/328698506397245440). Recent news that [SoundCloud posted a $53 million loss in 2015](http://mixmag.net/read/soundcloud-may-run-out-of-cash-after-suffering-a-51-22m-loss-in-2015-news) caused me to reflect on how a potential shutdown would impact the dance community at large and [me personally](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/822180098954690560). Due to the centralized tendencies of the web today, entire swaths of digital history[^2] can vanish from record.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vine is the latest reminder that we are creating a Digital Dark Age w huge gaps in the historical record (via obsolescence or deletion) üò©</p>&mdash; jenny (@fvrmvn) <a href="https://twitter.com/fvrmvn/status/791857105040908288">October 28, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I‚Äôve been thinking about ways we can make digital ‚Äúpassings,‚Äù [like that of Vine](https://medium.com/@vine/important-news-about-vine-909c5f4ae7a7#.2er2e8gxk), less painful on both a macro and personal scale. Let‚Äôs start with the macro, by reflecting on the shutdown of our favorite six-second looping video service.

Under the safety net of Twitter, Vine opted to enter a [read-only mode, release a version of the app that only allows local/Twitter sharing, and provide downloadable archives](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175169). Moreover, GIPHY pitched in and built a [migration tool](http://giphy.com/giphylovesvine).

This seems like the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do it. A _read-only_ period gives users time to brace for the shutdown and a _write-only_ tool grants creators the ability to produce atomic units of the service, despite its (future) absence (and hosting). When it comes down to platform migrations‚Äîno matter how well-intentioned‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to look past the fact that they‚Äôre essentially passings of the torch. Of course, with any hosted service, this process can (and will) continue indefinitely as they rise and fall. Third-party mirrors[^3, 4] (preferably those backed by enduring institutions) will probably be our best bet. The [challenge of preserving public digital records](https://twitter.com/jack/status/814924317590962176) will be one I‚Äôm excited to see our generation(s) take on with the help of historians.

On a personal level, I‚Äôve tried to approach backing up important files‚Äîphotos, videos, notes, and journals‚Äîas creating a digital attic for my future kids to (potentially) climb into one day. Structuring the folders to be intuitive, yet allow for a meandering exploration of my digital life. My files range from the typical‚Äî[screenshots](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/705791847319347200), camera uploads[^5], 9th grade Algebra 2 assignments, and [journal entries](/small-moments)‚Äîto the intimate‚Äî[voicemails from my parents](https://twitter.com/maiab/status/751500059875782656)[^6], notes on fun date spots/ideas, and failed attempts at a video diary. More concretely, I store these  digital memories in formats that I _think_ will stand the test of time‚Äîor at least be easily upconverted to their replacements. Plaintext ([Markdown](https://twitter.com/jxxf/status/789275320696406016)), PNGs, MP4s, and MP3s have been some of my picks. As an example, instead of keeping [first-person memories](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/817769190920777728) generated by [Snap‚Äôs Spectacles](https://www.spectacles.com) solely in their app, I‚Äôll save each one to my Camera Roll‚Äîwhich, in turn, get backed up to my Dropbox[^7].

On the note of backups, I‚Äôve also thought about how to hand off digital assets (most importantly my journal) when I pass, or in the case of an emergency. The last thing I‚Äôd want for my loved ones is trouble in tracking down files and critical account credentials. This may sound grim, but it‚Äôs important to think about as more of our _possessions become purely digital_.

People centuries from now will have the _potential_ to tap into our global [consciousness](https://twitter.com/naval/status/604009689337044992), view the world as we saw it, and experience lossless versions of our greatest creative outputs. To preserve this potential, we should mindfully sunset our products. On a personal level, think about that digital attic you would like to create for your relatives or (future) kid(s). Save digital content that could help them get to know you in ways you wish you could know your ancestors. Or, at least, let them uncover the [dank memes you revined](https://vine.co/v/iiWIUmAUAn6).
