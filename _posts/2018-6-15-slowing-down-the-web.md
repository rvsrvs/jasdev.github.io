iOS 12’s “[Screen Time](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/)“ might be the biggest, recent step forward in humane product design.

It packs usage reports, device pickup counts, enhanced Do Not Disturb controls, and granular notification settings. Yet, as I read the press release, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the feature is an OS-level Band-Aid over the networks called out: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, et al.

Fixing our collective relationship with these networks won’t happen over night and I’m not advocating for their absence. However, they could benefit from replicating aspects of the “[Slow Web](https://jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/)“—blogs, journaling, and RSS. Specifically, _decoupling_ reading and writing, preventing traditional notions of engagement at the protocol level, and allowing users to siphon content into smaller “ponds.”

## Decoupling Writing and Reading

Most networks implicitly couple the act of reading and writing. Not only are we expected to read Twitter, Instagram, or FB’s feeds, they’re designed for us to “write” back to them in the form of tweets and posts.

What if we broke this assumption, or even baked it into the network itself? Journaling does this for me. The habit is almost purely _write-only_, reserving reflection for longer timescales. Of the 1,928 entries—five years of memories—in my journal, I’ve only read a couple hundred. The dynamic nostalgically resembles the letters high school teachers made us write to our future, university selves.

It’s healthy to gut check whether or not to read _and_ write to networks. The conjunction might not always make sense. Personally, I use Swarm and GitHub as write-only feeds. I’ll checkin and commit, respectively, but rarely browse their feeds. There might be an opportunity for a service to use this decoupling to its advantage, as I noted in a previous post, “[Nostalgia and Upper Bounds](/nostalgia).“

>  [I]magine if services like Twitter allowed tweets to be posted at any time, and only surfaced the feed during specific, limited hours of the day. That could do wonders in eradicating continuous partial attention [and capture the joy of shared presence that floods Twitter during live events].

## Eliminating “Engagement”

Another trait of the Slow Web is preventing typical notions of “engagement.“ Likes, retweets, favorites, shares, reposts…the Lucky Charms of the Internet. RSS may be dead for all mainstream purposes (aside from quietly powering the podcast industry), but I’m a holdout. What’s special about RSS is its postal system-like nature. Feed entries arrive at a digestible pace and the protocol eliminates engagement entirely. Posts simply float out into the ether. Following my friends on both Twitter and RSS has been fascinating because of this. More specifically, when feed items aren’t cross-posted to normal social channels, it’s a small glimpse into their digital inner life.

Frankly, [anecdote about GA and only caring about the messages Distillations posts spark, mention of Village page].

## The Time Tracking Red Herring

- How a service punctuates your day is almost more important than the wall time you spend on it
- We don’t punctuate our calendars and sleep, why do we do the same for our attention?
    - What if we defaulted access to certain windows of the day?
