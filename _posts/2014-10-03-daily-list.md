Inspired by Jack Dorsey’s habit of reading a daily list, I decided to create my own [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me/dashboard) [plan](https://www.coach.me/plans/285255-read-daily-list) to achieve this goal.

Below is the list I read every morning as I leave my apartment. (I’ve added comments to provide context around a few points.)

---

* “How *lucky* am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.”
* Do the most **important** thing first each day.
* You’re **worth it** and you can do it.
* Imagine your desired outcome and work backwards to figure out immediate steps.
* Meditate on this list[^1].
* **Meditate**
* Replace the word problem with **opportunity**.
* Everything is worth it.
* Love is giving someone the power to destroy you and trusting them not to.
* Take a deep breath, remember your *practice*, you’ll be fine.
* Practice mental noting[^2].
* **Live on**.
* “Pass the coat.”
* Do small things with **great love**.
* “I’m glad you exist.”[^3]
* If you’re not failing, you’re not reaching high enough. Stay hungry. Be true. **Dream big**.
* Every decision, experience, success, and failure in life has brought me to **this moment**.
* The price of discipline is less than the **price of regret**.
* “I never saved anything for the swim back.”[^4]
* Don’t put off until tomorrow, what can be done today. Seriously.
* Take time to reflect.
* “Nobody cares about what you didn’t accomplish.”
* “When you go to work and aren’t a bit nervous that you can’t possibly do your job, find a more challenging one.”
