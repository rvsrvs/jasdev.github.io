“How’d you two become friends?” “…we met on Twitter!” This origin story has stemmed some of my dearest friendships, since making an account in 2011. What about ~~140~~ 280 characters fosters such strong connections? After letting the question distill for a year, a potential answer is starting to take shape.

Twitter has the magical ability to cultivate _ambient intimacy_. Each day, folks in your graph get a slice of your [thoughts](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/811601905101180928), [joys](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/533567863408189441), and [embarrassing moments](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/829004906170347520)[^1]. The “ambient” nature of this dynamic is crucial. A simple “follow”—say of user _X_—translates into _X_’s online consciousness being threaded into yours. Moreover, this intimacy can span _years_, even before meeting _X_ in-person. One of my great friends, [Ryan](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aryandawidjan+jasdev), followed me for multiple years prior to cold emailing after my move to the city.

Below, I attempt to break down the components that give rise to ambient intimacy and how it’s exhibited in other mediums.

## Deconstructing Ambient Intimacy

Ambient intimacy appears to have a few constituent parts. Namely, effortlessness, a _longitudinal_ surface area, and deliberate choices around nomenclature/context of relationships in the given medium. Let’s step through each.

### Effortlessness

To catch up with friends and loved ones, a common approach is to ask “how are things going?”-style questions. They’re _well-intentioned_ gestures that are necessary on occasion. But, they have a sticking point: an asymmetric amount of “effort” involved between the asker and the recipient. Firing off a quick “how’s the week been?” message takes seconds. To answer it, one has to (lossily) translate a week’s worth of emotions, interactions, and thoughts into text, which takes a lot of emotional energy. While the asymmetry is resolved by reciprocating the question, the net effort for both parties is still high. Ambient intimacy navigates around this. The intent _isn’t_ a replacement for genuine catch-ups, but rather a lightweight way to maintain the _pulse_ of a relationship. Services attempt to “reduce“ this energy spend through specific cues. For instance, I’d often use [Timehop](https://timehop.com) entries as the starting point in a conversation that would otherwise be awkward to resurface out of the blue. Another example (which we’ll dive into later) is Apple’s Activity watchOS and iOS apps. Throughout the day, Activity will send notifications as friends complete workouts and close their [Move, Stand, and Exercise rings](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/#activity-tracker).

![Reply dialog to the notification with two options currently in view: “💪💪💪” and “Ready or not…”](/public/images/activity_reply.png)

watchOS makes cheering on my friends easier by pre-populating replies. Further, there isn’t an extra, explicit step to trigger these notifications. They just silently fan out to all shared contacts upon workout completion.

### Longitudinal Surface Area

Ambient intimacy isn’t a one-and-done checkbox; it takes a while to bake. I visualize this intimacy as a sort of _longitudinal_ surface area. By vulnerably sharing on mediums like Twitter, I’m able to increase the area of my consciousness over time, which folks can use as a starting point in taking relationships online to offline. Tangentially, there’s something special about time stamping tweets (or whatever the atomic unit of the medium is). Being able to look back on timestamped interactions adds depth to a relationship that “we’ve known one another for eight years!“ glosses over.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jasdev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jasdev</a> congrats on the move. are you in NYC now man?</p>&mdash; ryan (@ryandawidjan) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/633777052957736960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">its been a great year hangin</p>&mdash; ryan (@ryandawidjan) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/768482417200037890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While ambient intimacy shouldn’t be strictly regimented, it tends to fall into a natural cadence. My Twitter following graph’s consciousness is in my pocket _every day_. That’s incredible to think about. As we’ll explore in a bit, different mediums cultivate intimacy at specific paces depending on the unit of consumption (e.g. tweets ⇒ daily, podcasts ⇒ weekly or monthly).

### Network Nomenclature and Context

The final components are network nomenclature and the context of consumption. First, the nouns and verbs a service uses affect the weight of a relationship. Nuanced differences between “subscriber,“ “follower,” “friend,” or “connection” shape our interpretation of the edges between nodes[^2]. This is part of the reason why losing a Facebook _friend_ stings a bit more than losing a Twitter _follower_ (aside from bidirectionality requirement).

Second, _where_ you consume content in the medium matters. Context can span a few dimensions:

- Public (e.g. (Instagram&#124;Snap) Stories or tweets, sans protected accounts)
- Private (Direct messages)
- Semi-private (group threads—Snap does an amazing job at [blurring the lines between public and semi-private](/group-dynamics#snap-threads))
- Adjacency
    - What units of the medium are “next to“ each other? For instance, sending a birthday wish over email can be a diamond in the rough for some, but _accidentally_ induce an ounce of “work“ for those who strive for inbox zero. Similarly, sending [birthday wishes over Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=birthday%20from%3Ajasdev) is a small, public leap of faith. But, it’s sometimes hard to avoid comparing them to tweets about our current administration’s blunders being a scroll away.

Both nomenclature and context tie back into ambient intimacy. By carefully [choosing the labels](/peeling-labels) we use in our products and the context in which they’re used, we can alter the nature of connections that are formed[^3].

## Other Mediums

Twitter seems to foster ambient intimacy, but where else does it crop up? I’ve noticed it in four other places:

### Podcasts

Having someone’s voice in your head day over day, week over week, or month over month is powerful. On a long enough timescale, it almost feels like you know the host(s), even if you’ve never met them. Moreover, depending on the [context in which you consume podcasts](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/914839369831329794), the hosts may “anchor” themselves to parts of your routine—commuting, cleaning, cooking, etc. Personally, I noticed this with my friend [Sam](https://twitter.com/soffes). Prior to meeting in-person, I listened to a show he co-hosted, [Immutable](https://spec.fm/podcasts/immutable), for months (and even [submitted questions](https://overcast.fm/+FGbTyte_o/06:44) to be discussed on the podcast). This made meeting him at a conference feel like catching up with an old friend.

### Apple Watch Activity

I’ve worn my Apple Watch every day since April 2015 (minus a week-long retreat). While my praise for the device—[when used to check one’s phone _less frequently_](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/815656034714996737)—could be a post in its entirety, the Activity app deserves a special mention. Apple may have accidentally created a network here that furthers its staying power.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Dfc0udtvXE">https://t.co/Dfc0udtvXE</a> on  Watch has a good chance to be another accidental social network that locks people into the Apple ecosystem.</p>&mdash; Avneesh Kohli (@avneeshk91) <a href="https://twitter.com/avneeshk91/status/871045112234692608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As mentioned in the “Effortlessness” section, Activity Sharing let’s me _passively_ broadcast my fitness milestones and workouts. On the receiving end, it feels—figuratively and literally—like a pulse that holds so much potential. I’m able to get a slice of my friends’ days, no matter the distance, delivered right to my wrist.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Activity app on (watch|i)OS has the same effect. Getting pushes to my wrist for each of my friends&#39; workouts allows me to cheer them on</p>&mdash; Jasdev Singh (@jasdev) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/841059908120412161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### RSS

RSS maybe may be “dead“ for all _mainstream_ purposes (aside from quietly powering the podcast industry), but I’m a holdout. The Web seems to oscillate between algorithmic and raw feeds (e.g., RSS) and we’re currently on the upswing of the former. However, what’s special about RSS is its postal system-like nature. Feed entries arrive at a digestible pace and the protocol _prevents_ any typical notion of “engagement.“ No likes, RTs, or comments. Posts simply float out into the ether. Following my friends on both Twitter and RSS has been fascinating because of this. More specifically, when feed items _aren’t_ cross-posted to normal social channels, it’s a small glimpse into their digital inner life.

Ambient intimacy has been the invisible foundation upon which my favorite services and protocols are built. I wholeheartedly believe there’s a spectrum here with gaps to be filled. My gut is telling me that the next wave of social products are those that bring this intimacy to the forefront.

## Related Thoughts and Footnotes:

[^1]: This is predicated on the assumption that one’s “true” and “digital“ selves are _roughly_ aligned. If they diverge (i.e. one acts differently online than in-person), the capacity for ambient intimacy that survives the online-offline jump suffers.

[^2]: [Will](https://twitter.com/willhoekenga) and [Nathan](https://twitter.com/nbashaw) touched on this in [episode 17](https://overcast.fm/+GsgNyxmCU/27:20) of the (now defunct) Hardbound podcast (timestamped link).
