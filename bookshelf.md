My reading is (sometimes-evenly) split between blogs and books. While the merits of the two mediums are [heavily](https://stratechery.com/2017/books-and-blogs/) [debated](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/01/16/blogs-vs-books/), I try to stick with a mix of both.

## Blogs

[Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) is my tool of choice in navigating web content. Here are a few ways to follow along: [web](http://instapaper.com/p/jasdev), [RSS](http://instapaper.com/starred/rss/4750197/tes3ESKY5E01Sx4DKAfUYK9rUQ), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/whatjasdevreads).

## Books

Inspired by [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)‚Äôs attempt at a digital ‚Äúbookshelf,‚Äù I‚Äôve decided to catalog mine here.

Below is a (fairly) updated list of all of the (physical&#124;digital) books I own (in no particular order, without affiliate links).

### Legend

- üéß Listened to audiobook
- üìñ Read ebook or physical book
- ‚úèÔ∏è In progress
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Would gift to a friend or loved one
