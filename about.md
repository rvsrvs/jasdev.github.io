## [Thoughts](/thoughts) ([RSS](/thoughts.xml))

An attempt to create a public, high-cadence log of what’s on my mind. Along the spectrum between [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jasdev) and my blog, [this journal](/thoughts) sits in-between. Unpolished thoughts, developed over time.

## How’d I End Up in NYC?

I’m originally from and grew up in [Fairfax Station, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia). After graduation in 2014, I headed out to [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) for about a year. But, I eventually found myself back on the East-Coast. The _only_ part of the “Where do you see yourself in five years?” question I feel remotely confident answering is that I’ll still be in New York.

## What Am I Struggling With Right Now?

- [Finding an editor](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/916265441584140288). A long-term goal I’m working towards at the moment is writing professionally. Hiring an editor is likely a point along that trajectory. If you have any recommendations, it’d mean a ton if you [sent them my way](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

## What I’d Love to Help You With

- Editing. I wholeheartedly believe that [editors help craft better writers](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/790202105839640580). If you need a pair of eyes on a post, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/jasdev) (DMs open).
- [Holding space](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/831682922704945152). I learn the most when listening to [folks from walks of life unlike mine](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/906596468873728000). I’d love to help work through an issue (of any variety) by holding space for you to talk about it.

## Questions I’m Thinking About

- Ways to [slow down one’s perception of time](https://twitter.com/naval/status/769745071675539456)
- How can we foster [effortful learning](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721414540167) (espoused in [_Make it Stick_](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013)) in an age of fleeting content (tweets, snaps, and faster-paced blogs)?
- Does vertical scrolling as a design pattern have any (unintended) subconscious consequences?
- Whether “being present” is subtractive or additive?
- What would a “slow“ (social or information) network look like? One where consumption might be limited to specific cadences or hours of the day.

## What I Would Like To Be Known For

- Making the world better through people.
- A friend who [loves infinitely](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/181dbeacaf083497ad10f080247a2e5b9b4af401/core-values.md#L7), but also [challenges peers to grow](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/869938469153492999).
- Someone who [thinks aloud](/thoughts) as a reminder that we usually [experience similar invisible wounds](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/784511992618971136).

## Things I Spend/Spent Way Too Much Time On

- [Dance music](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh) (wrote my [thesis on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irAFO2rGvTg)).
- [Journaling](/small-moments). Starting in July 2013, I’ve kept a daily journal of my inner life.
- [Thinking about group fitness](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/852130577461465089) and how to build products that help us build better versions of ourselves.
- Following [corgi accounts](https://www.instagram.com/zoeydacorgi/) on Instagram.
- Tetris. I used to be globally ranked in [Cascade Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Worlds#Arcade_mode) when I was a teenager.
