Hey! I’m Jasdev. Distillations is a little corner of the Internet where I put my writing with the help from [peers around me](/village).

### About

I’m an [aspiring educator](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) in New York. Outside of Distillations, I spend my time running, [listening to dance music](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh), and nerding out over poetry and mathematics.

Currently, I’m second-timing it at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in their [Spring 2, ’20 batch](https://www.recurse.com/blog/152-RC-is-online-only-until-at-least-May) (earlier, F1 ’15). Prior, I spent three and a half years on [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/)’s engineering team and previously worked on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)’s. Before that, I interned at Twitter ([KPCB ’13](http://kpcbfellows.com/)), Fitocracy, and Microsoft while studying mathematics at [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/) (SEAS ’14). And in between, I took breaks to attend Orbital’s [Engineering Management Studio](https://orbital.nyc/studios/) (Fall ’18) and [Advanced Functional Programming](http://afp.school) (Summer ’19).

I’m originally from and grew up in [Fairfax Station, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia).

One of the most impactful questions I’ve come across is “what would you like to be known for?” Below is my answer to point out traits I try to express.

- Making the world better through people.
- A friend who loves infinitely, yet [challenges peers to grow](https://pinboard.in/u:jasdev/b:545f16fe01bd).
- Someone who thinks aloud as a reminder that we often have similar, invisible wounds.
