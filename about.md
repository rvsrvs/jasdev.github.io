My name is Jasdev Singh. Distillations is a container for my thoughts on human be­hav­ior, our relationship with technology, and engineering. Since writing of this kind develops over time, I won’t keep a strict posting schedule. But, you can expect monthly updates. The collection wouldn’t be possible without the incredible feedback and illustrations from [peers around me](/village).

Also, I’ve kept some older—and _very embarrassing_—posts around to allow for nostalgic explorations of past work (and hopefully mile mark my progress?).

### About Me

I’m an engineer and writer in New York. Outside of Distillations, I spend my time cycling, listening to [dance music](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh) (wrote my [thesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irAFO2rGvTg) on the genre), and building products that help us build better versions of ourselves.

Currently, I spend my days on [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/)’s engineering team. Previously, I built APIs and apps at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), and the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=bb4cdf5d8bb2835f896d762d5b51cecb) (F1 ’15). Before that, I interned at Twitter ([KPCB ’13](http://kpcbfellows.com/)), [Fitocracy](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/641428685275447296), and Microsoft while studying mathematics at [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/) (SEAS ’14).

I’m originally from and grew up in [Fairfax Station, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia). After graduation in 2014, I headed out to San Francisco for a year. But, I eventually found myself back on the East Coast. The only part of the “where do you see yourself in five years?” I feel remotely confident answering is that I’ll still be in New York.

One of the most impactful questions I’ve come across is “[what would you like to be known for](https://overcast.fm/+Fg9IeSC2o/0:37)?” I’ve added my answer below to point out my north stars and keep me accountable.

- Making the world better through people.
- A friend who [loves infinitely](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/181dbeacaf083497ad10f080247a2e5b9b4af401/core-values.md#L7), but also [challenges peers to grow](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/869938469153492999).
- Someone who [thinks aloud](/thoughts) as a reminder that we usually [experience similar invisible wounds](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/784511992618971136).
