Hey! I’m Jasdev. Distillations is a little corner of the Internet where I put my writing with the help from [peers around me](/village).

### About

I’m an engineer and writer in New York. Outside of Distillations, I spend my time cycling (indoors), [listening to dance music](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh) (trance, melodic dubstep, progressive, deep, and tech house), and nerding out about math (mostly Category Theory).

Currently, I spend my work days on [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/)’s engineering team and previously did the same on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)’s. Prior, I interned at Twitter ([KPCB ’13](http://kpcbfellows.com/)), Fitocracy, and Microsoft while studying mathematics at [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/) (SEAS ’14). And in between, I took breaks to attend the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) (F1 ’15), Orbital’s [Engineering Management Studio](https://orbital.nyc/studios/) (Fall ’18), and [Advanced Functional Programming](http://afp.school) (Summer ’19).

I’m originally from and grew up in [Fairfax Station, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia). After graduation, I headed out to San Francisco, but eventually found myself back on the East Coast a little over a year later.

One of the most impactful questions I’ve come across is “[what would you like to be known for](https://overcast.fm/+Fg9IeSC2o/0:37)?” Below is my answer to point out traits I try to express.

- Making the world better through people.
- A friend who loves infinitely, yet [challenges peers to grow](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=224735391342335&id=100014176268390).
- Someone who thinks aloud as a reminder that we usually experience similar invisible wounds.
