My name is Jasdev Singh. Distillations is a container for my thoughts on human behavior, our relationship with technology, and engineering. Since writing of this kind develops over time, I won’t keep a strict posting schedule. But, you can expect monthly updates. The collection wouldn’t be possible without feedback and illustrations from [peers around me](/village).

### About Me

I’m an engineer and writer in New York. Outside of Distillations, I spend my time cycling, listening to [dance music](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh), and building products that help us build better versions of ourselves.

Currently, I spend my days on [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/)’s engineering team. Previously, I built APIs and apps at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), and the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=bb4cdf5d8bb2835f896d762d5b51cecb) (F1 ’15). Before that, I interned at Twitter ([KPCB ’13](http://kpcbfellows.com/)), [Fitocracy](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/641428685275447296), and Microsoft while studying mathematics at [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/) (SEAS ’14).

I’m originally from and grew up in [Fairfax Station, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia). After graduation in 2014, I headed out to San Francisco for a year. But, I eventually found myself back on the East Coast.

One of the most impactful questions I’ve come across is “[what would you like to be known for](https://overcast.fm/+Fg9IeSC2o/0:37)?” I’ve added my answer below to point out my north stars.

- Making the world better through people.
- A friend who loves infinitely, but also [challenges peers to grow](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=224735391342335&id=100014176268390).
- Someone who thinks aloud as a reminder that we usually experience similar invisible wounds.
